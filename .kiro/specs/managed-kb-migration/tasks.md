# Implementation Plan: Managed Knowledge Base Migration

## Overview

> **READ `HANDOFF.md` FIRST.** Groups 1–14 are built and deployed to dev and prod,
> but a checked box here means "written and reviewed", not "verified by running".
> **Sixteen defects were found only by running it** — every one reviewed clean and
> deployed clean — and they are recorded in `HANDOFF.md` §5, not here. Section 16
> below carries the work those findings opened. Two of them (§5.40, §5.41) mean the
> managed backend currently gives a *worse answer* than legacy on some questions,
> which is the most important open item in the feature.

Introduce Amazon Bedrock Managed Knowledge Base as a second retrieval backend
behind a single abstraction seam, then migrate knowledge bases to it one at a time,
opt-in, with rollback available throughout.

Task order enforces the deployment rule that **backend code never deploys before
the IAM and resources it requires**. Groups 1–2 are platform-only and change no
behaviour. Groups 3–11 land backend code that stays dark behind flags. Groups
12–13 enable the pilot and opt-in migration. Groups 14–15 add the user-facing
surfaces and the pre-promotion verification gate.

**Scope:** §14.7 phases 1–4 only. Managed-by-default, stopping legacy writes,
reclaiming legacy vectors, and removing the old pipeline are a follow-up spec.
All three flags — managed-default, migration, and reconciler arming — ship **off**.

## Tasks

- [x] 1. Platform: additive schema and IAM (no behaviour change)
  - [x] 1.1 Add the sparse work-discovery GSI to the assistants table
    - In `infrastructure/lib/constructs/rag/rag-data-construct.ts`, add GSI
      `KbWorkIndex` with partition key `GSI7_PK` and sort key `GSI7_SK`, both
      STRING, `projectionType: ALL`
    - **GSI7, not GSI1** — the table already has six indexes using `GSI_PK`/`GSI_SK`
      for the first and `GSI2_PK` through `GSI6_PK` thereafter
    - Follow the sparse pattern and comment style of the adjacent `DueSyncIndex`
      (GSI4), `AgentDirectoryIndex` (GSI5) and `AgentReportsIndex` (GSI6): keys are
      written only while the record is eligible, so ineligible and pinned knowledge
      bases are invisible to the dispatcher's query by physics rather than by filter
    - Add `GSI7_PK` / `GSI7_SK` to the generic assistant-update path's immutable
      attribute list, mirroring `GSI5_*`, so a routine edit cannot resurrect a work
      key on a knowledge base that has left the queue
    - ⚠️ **This consumes the entire `rag-assistants` GSI budget for whichever
      release ships it.** DynamoDB's `UpdateTable` permits exactly ONE GSI creation
      or deletion per call, and CloudFormation issues one `UpdateTable` per changed
      table, so a release that adds a second index to this table fails the deploy
      and rolls the whole stack back. This is not theoretical: it took production
      down on 2026-08-01 in release 1.12.0, when `AgentDirectoryIndex` and
      `AgentReportsIndex` arrived in separate `develop` merges and collapsed into a
      single prod update. If any other in-flight spec adds a GSI to
      `rag-assistants`, the two must ship in different releases.
    - Regenerate the committed inventory after adding the index:
      `cd infrastructure && UPDATE_GSI_INVENTORY=1 npx jest gsi-update-limit`, and
      confirm the diff is exactly one line. `infrastructure/test/gsi-update-limit.test.ts`
      fails until this is done, and `scripts/release/check-gsi-update-limit.mjs`
      re-checks it against `origin/main` on PRs into `main`.
    - _Requirements: 15.14, 15.13_

  - [x] 1.2 Create the Bedrock knowledge base service role
    - New construct `infrastructure/lib/constructs/managed-kb/managed-kb-role-construct.ts`
    - Trust policy: `bedrock.amazonaws.com` with `aws:SourceAccount` equal to the
      account and `ArnLike` on `AWS:SourceArn` scoped to `knowledge-base/*`
    - Grant S3 read on the documents bucket conditioned on `aws:ResourceAccount`
    - Grant `bedrock:InvokeModel` on `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0` only (required
      because Requirement 8.5 pins `embeddingModelType: CUSTOM`)
    - Grant `cloudwatch:PutMetricData` scoped to the non-reserved
      `${prefix}/ManagedKb` namespace. NOT `AWS/Bedrock/KnowledgeBases`: CloudWatch
      reserves every namespace beginning with `AWS` and rejects writes to them, so
      an `AWS/...`-scoped grant authorizes nothing while looking correct. Bedrock's
      own `AWS/Bedrock/KnowledgeBases` metrics are a read source (Req 20.13), not a
      publish target
    - Publish the role ARN to SSM at `/${prefix}/managed-kb/service-role-arn`
    - _Requirements: 20.1, 20.2, 20.4, 20.5, 20.10, 8.5, 8.9_

  - [x] 1.3 Grant caller permissions for provisioning, ingestion, and retrieval
    - Separate policy statements with distinct SIDs for: provisioner/migrator CRUD
      (`bedrock:CreateKnowledgeBase`, `CreateDataSource`, `DeleteKnowledgeBase`,
      `DeleteDataSource`, `ListKnowledgeBases`, `GetKnowledgeBase`), direct
      ingestion (`IngestKnowledgeBaseDocuments`, `DeleteKnowledgeBaseDocuments`,
      `GetKnowledgeBaseDocuments`), and inference (`bedrock:Retrieve`)
    - Add `iam:PassRole` on the service role conditioned on `iam:PassedToService`
      equal to `bedrock.amazonaws.com`
    - Attach retrieval to the AgentCore Runtime role and the App API task role;
      attach CRUD only to the migration Lambdas' roles
    - _Requirements: 20.3, 20.6_

  - [x] 1.4 Write CDK assertions for the IAM conditions
    - New `infrastructure/test/managed-kb.test.ts`, following
      `infrastructure/test/kb-sync.test.ts`
    - Assert the `aws:SourceAccount` and `ArnLike` `AWS:SourceArn` conditions, the
      `iam:PassedToService` condition, the `aws:ResourceAccount` S3 condition, and
      the presence of the `PutMetricData` grant on the calling identities, and its
      **absence** on the service role
    - Assert the S3 statement's **Resource** as well as its Condition:
      `aws:ResourceAccount` scopes the account, not the bucket, so without a
      Resource assertion the grant can widen to every bucket in the account (file
      uploads, fine-tuning, artifacts, SPA) with all tests still green
    - Assert the `PutMetricData` namespace does not begin with `AWS`, so nobody
      reverts it to the reserved `AWS/Bedrock/KnowledgeBases` namespace that
      authorizes no publish
    - The `PutMetricData` assertion matters because metric publishing is
      best-effort: omit the grant and metrics silently vanish while requests keep
      succeeding
    - _Requirements: 20.9, 24.10, 24.13_

- [x] 2. Platform: worker resources and config
  - [x] 2.1 Add the migration construct with dispatcher, worker, and reconciler
    - New `infrastructure/lib/constructs/managed-kb/kb-migration-construct.ts`,
      following `infrastructure/lib/constructs/kb-sync/kb-sync-construct.ts`
    - Three DockerImage Lambdas sharing ONE image
      (`backend/Dockerfile.kb-migration`)
    - Byte-stable bootstrap stub at
      `infrastructure/bootstrap-assets/kb-migration/`, per the
      platform-as-bootstrap pattern
    - Publish generated function names to SSM under `/${prefix}/kb-migration/`
    - EventBridge `rate()` schedule into the dispatcher and into the reconciler
    - Wire the construct in `infrastructure/lib/platform-stack.ts`
    - _Requirements: 14.1, 15.13, 15.14_

  - [x] 2.2 Add the ingestion consumer Lambda
    - Same construct; triggered by the documents bucket `ObjectCreated`
      notification, wired in `platform-stack.ts` alongside the existing
      notification to avoid a circular dependency
    - Timeout ≥300 s (a 50 KiB PDF was measured at 264 s) and a dead-letter queue
    - _Requirements: 10.1, 10.9_

  - [x] 2.3 Add configuration properties and flags
    - In `infrastructure/lib/config.ts`, add a `managedKb` section carrying
      `newDefault`, `migrationEnabled`, `reconcilerArmed`, per-owner byte cap
      defaults by role tier, and the retention window in days
    - Follow the 7-step config pattern: `config.ts` interface → `loadConfig` →
      construct → `scripts/common/load-env.sh` → `synth.sh` and `deploy.sh`
      (identical context flags) → workflow job-level `env:` → GitHub variable
    - All three booleans default to **false**, and an empty string resolves to
      false
    - _Requirements: 19.1, 19.2, 19.3, 19.4, 19.5, 19.8, 12.2, 14.7, 15.11_

  - [x] 2.4 Add tagging for reconciliation and teardown
    - Tag every runtime-created knowledge base with `prefix`, `env`, `appKbId`, and
      an opaque `ownerUserId`
    - The owner tag must be an opaque identifier, never an email address or other
      PII
    - This is a hard prerequisite, not housekeeping: the Reconciler's tag-filtered
      `ListKnowledgeBases` and the teardown script both read these tags
    - _Requirements: 20.11, 20.12_

  - [x] 2.5 Add account-level alarms
    - New alarms in the managed-kb construct on total managed storage, managed
      knowledge base count against 80% of the 10,000 quota, daily
      Knowledge-Base `usagetype` cost, and sustained non-zero `KbOrphansFound`
    - Use `TreatMissingData.NOT_BREACHING`, matching the posture of the existing
      kb-sync, scheduled-runs and prompt-cache observability constructs
    - Per-owner caps bound one user; these bound the fleet, and the gap between
      ~$169/month expected and ~$15,000/month permitted is why they are required
    - _Requirements: 12.13_

- [x] 3. KB_Record data layer
  - [x] 3.1 Define the KB_Record model
    - New `backend/src/apis/shared/kb_backend/records.py`
    - Keys `PK=AST#{assistant_id}`, `SK=KB#{app_kb_id}`, with
      `app_kb_id == assistant_id` in this phase
    - Fields per the design's data-model table, including `retrievalEngine`,
      `provisioningState`, `awsKbId`, `awsDataSourceId`, immutable embedding
      config, `storedBytes`, `reservedBytes`, `lastRetrievedAt`, migration state
      with generation and lease, and lifecycle exemption flags
    - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.5_

  - [x] 3.2 Implement conditional state transitions
    - `create_provisioning`, `attach_aws_ids`, `promote_engine`,
      `rollback_engine`, `set_migration_state`, `acquire_lease`
    - Every transition uses a DynamoDB condition expression; `promote_engine` is
      conditional on converged catch-up so two workers cannot both promote
    - Sparse GSI attributes are written on entering an eligible state and
      **removed** on reaching a terminal state
    - _Requirements: 15.8, 15.10, 15.13, 17.1, 17.5_

  - [x] 3.3 Write property test for engine resolution by absence
    - **Property 1: absence means legacy**
    - Using `hypothesis`, for any KB_Record shape with no `retrievalEngine`
      attribute, verify resolution returns the legacy backend, and verify no code
      path writes the literal `"s3vectors"` to a record that did not already carry
      it
    - **Validates: Requirements 1.6, 1.7, 6.6**
    - File: `backend/tests/property/test_pbt_kb_engine_resolution.py`

  - [x] 3.4 Write unit tests for conditional transitions
    - Concurrent `create_provisioning` yields exactly one winner
    - Concurrent `promote_engine` yields exactly one winner
    - Terminal transitions remove the GSI attributes
    - File: `backend/tests/shared/test_kb_records.py`
    - _Requirements: 7.4, 15.10, 15.13_

- [x] 4. Backend abstraction seam
  - [x] 4.1 Define the protocol and canonical chunk shape
    - New `backend/src/apis/shared/kb_backend/protocol.py`
    - `KnowledgeBaseBackend` Protocol with `search`, `ingest`, `delete_document`
    - Frozen `Chunk` dataclass whose score field is named `relevance` and is
      documented as higher-is-more-relevant
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1_

  - [x] 4.2 Implement the backend resolver
    - New `backend/src/apis/shared/kb_backend/resolver.py`
    - Reads `retrievalEngine` from the KB_Record; absence resolves to
      `S3VectorsBackend`
    - _Requirements: 1.4, 1.6_

  - [x] 4.3 Extract the legacy backend verbatim
    - New `backend/src/apis/shared/kb_backend/s3vectors_backend.py`
    - Move the existing S3 Vectors search path from
      `apis/shared/assistants/rag_service.py` and
      `apis/shared/embeddings/bedrock_embeddings.py` without functional change
    - Convert S3 Vectors cosine **distance** to **relevance** inside this adapter
    - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 2.2_

  - [x] 4.4 Convert the entry point into a facade
    - In `apis/shared/assistants/rag_service.py`, reduce
      `search_assistant_knowledgebase_with_formatting(assistant_id, query, top_k=5)`
      to resolve-then-delegate, preserving its public signature
    - Keep emitting a `distance` key in the formatted result, derived from
      `relevance`, so no existing consumer breaks on the field rename
    - Neither of the two call sites
      (`inference_api/chat/routes.py`, `app_api/assistants/routes.py`) changes
    - _Requirements: 1.5, 3.4_

  - [x] 4.5 Write property test for score direction equivalence
    - **Property 2: ranking is backend-independent**
    - Using `hypothesis`, for any list of chunks with distinct scores, verify both
      backends return the known-best chunk first after adapter conversion
    - This is the only test that can catch a silent ranking inversion; without it
      the failure mode produces no error, just worse answers
    - **Validates: Requirements 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 24.1**
    - File: `backend/tests/property/test_pbt_kb_score_direction.py`

  - [x] 4.6 Apply the document-status filter above the seam, on both backends
    - Move the `status == "complete"` post-filter into the facade so there is one
      implementation covering both backends
    - It works on the managed path only because `customDocumentIdentifier` is the
      platform `document_id` (task 8.4); the filter needs a `document_id` per chunk
      to join on
    - Keep it on the managed path even though managed ingestion makes it largely
      redundant — removing it in the same change that swaps the engine would
      confound the comparison
    - Apply the 2,000-character context cap in the same place, for the same reason
    - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3_

  - [x] 4.7 Write test for parity properties on the managed path
    - Assert `top_k=5`, the 2,000-character cap, the status filter, and the
      500-character citation clip all hold on the managed backend, not just legacy
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

  - [x] 4.8 Write architecture test for the Lambda import constraint
    - Assert `apis.shared.kb_backend` does not transitively import
      `apis.shared.assistants`, whose `__init__` drags in the embeddings stack
    - Add alongside the existing boundary tests in `backend/tests/architecture/`
    - Keep `kb_backend/__init__.py` empty and heavy imports function-local, matching
      the convention in `kb_sync/records.py`
    - _Requirements: 24.15_

- [x] 5. Query clamp
  - [x] 5.1 Implement the query guard
    - New `backend/src/apis/shared/kb_backend/query_guard.py` with
      `MAX_QUERY_CHARS = 10_000`
    - Applied in the facade before backend dispatch so both backends are protected
      identically; never raises
    - Emit a `KbQueryClamped` metric on truncation
    - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 22.3_

  - [x] 5.2 Remove the stale no-validation assertion
    - In `apis/shared/embeddings/bedrock_embeddings.py`, delete the inline comment
      stating the query is a "short string, no token validation needed"
    - It is true only because Titan v2 tolerates ~32,000 characters; Managed KB
      caps `Retrieve` input at 10,000 and the limit is not adjustable
    - _Requirements: 4.5_

  - [x] 5.3 Write property test for the clamp
    - **Property 3: clamp is total and non-throwing**
    - Using `hypothesis`, for any input string of any length, verify the output is
      at most 10,000 characters, the function never raises, and a truncation signal
      is emitted exactly when the input exceeded the cap
    - **Validates: Requirements 4.1, 4.3, 4.4**
    - File: `backend/tests/property/test_pbt_kb_query_clamp.py`

- [x] 6. Fail-closed document status filter
  - [x] 6.1 Make the status filter fail closed
    - In `apis/shared/assistants/rag_service.py`, change
      `_filter_vectors_by_document_status` so both fallback paths drop chunks
      instead of returning them unfiltered:
      the missing-table-name branch (currently `valid_doc_ids = doc_ids`) and the
      outer exception handler (currently `valid_doc_ids = doc_ids  # Graceful
      degradation`)
    - Leave the per-document handler as-is; it already fails closed
    - Emit `KbStatusFilterFailClosed` at error level, distinct from an ordinary
      empty-result log line
    - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 22.4_

  - [x] 6.2 Record the supersession in the prior spec
    - In `.kiro/specs/reliable-document-deletion/requirements.md`, annotate
      Requirement 3.4 as superseded by Requirement 5 of this spec
    - That requirement specified the fail-open deliberately, so retiring it is a
      supersession and must be recorded rather than silently contradicted
    - _Requirements: 5.5_

  - [x] 6.3 Write property test for fail-closed behaviour
    - **Property 4: unconfirmable status never leaks**
    - Using `hypothesis`, for any set of vectors and any injected table-level
      failure or missing table-name condition, verify zero chunks are returned
    - **Validates: Requirements 5.1, 5.2, 24.6**
    - File: `backend/tests/property/test_pbt_kb_status_fail_closed.py`

  - [x] 6.4 Update existing tests that assert the fail-open contract
    - Search `backend/tests/` for tests asserting unfiltered fallback and invert
      their expectations, citing this spec's Requirement 5
    - _Requirements: 5.5_

- [x] 7. Byte cap accounting
  - [x] 7.1 Implement reserve / commit / release
    - New `backend/src/apis/shared/kb_backend/byte_cap.py`
    - `reserve` is a conditional update failing when
      `storedBytes + reservedBytes + n > cap`; `commit` moves reserved to stored;
      `release` returns the reservation on failure
    - Resolve the per-owner cap by role tier, defaulting **below** the existing
      1 GB user-files precedent
    - Determine size from an S3 `HEAD` on the stored object, never from a
      client-reported value
    - Do not read `RawDataSize` for enforcement; it returned 0 datapoints for a
      directly-ingested document and remains unconfirmed
    - _Requirements: 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.6, 12.7, 12.8_

  - [x] 7.2 Document the retrieval-quota payer decision
    - Record in the design whether the knowledge base owner or the invoking user
      consumes retrieval quota, and implement accordingly
    - _Requirements: 12.10_

  - [x] 7.3 Write property test for reservation races
    - **Property 5: the cap is never exceeded under concurrency**
    - Using `hypothesis`, for any interleaving of N concurrent reserve/commit
      operations against a cap, verify the committed total never exceeds the cap
      and released reservations are fully returned
    - **Validates: Requirements 12.4, 12.5, 12.6, 24.7**
    - File: `backend/tests/property/test_pbt_kb_byte_cap.py`

  - [x] 7.4 Enforce the cap on the migration re-ingest path
    - The Migration_Worker reserves for the **whole snapshot** before entering
      `shadow`, and fails the migration up front rather than part-migrating a corpus
      that cannot fit
    - Surface the failure as a plain-language reason with the option to request an
      elevated tier
    - Migration is the largest byte-adding operation in the system and the only one
      that runs unattended, so it is both the easiest and the worst place to omit
      the check
    - Emit `KbByteCapRejected` on rejection
    - _Requirements: 12.11, 12.12, 12.14_

  - [x] 7.5 Write test for migration byte-cap rejection
    - A corpus exceeding the owner's remaining allowance fails before `shadow`, and
      leaves no partially-ingested managed knowledge base behind
    - _Requirements: 12.11, 12.12_

- [x] 8. Managed backend: provisioning and retrieval
  - [x] 8.1 Implement the provisioning saga
    - New `backend/src/apis/shared/kb_backend/provisioning.py`
    - Write the KB_Record in `provisioning` **before** calling AWS; attach returned
      ids with a conditional update
    - `CreateKnowledgeBase` with `type="MANAGED"`, `roleArn`, and
      `managedKnowledgeBaseConfiguration` carrying the embedding pin (it has no
      required members, but the pin has nowhere else to live — NOT literally `{}`);
      omit `storageConfiguration` entirely
    - Build the `clientToken` programmatically to satisfy the **33-character
      minimum** and persist it so a retry reuses it — a natural
      `{id}-{variant}-kb` token is 31 characters and fails client-side validation
    - Treat "unable to verify the specified embedding model" as **retryable**; it
      was observed as pure IAM eventual consistency against a model confirmed
      ACTIVE and invokable
    - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, 8.1, 8.2_

  - [x] 8.2 Create the CUSTOM connector data source
    - `dataSourceConfiguration.type = "MANAGED_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_CONNECTOR"` with the
      real type in
      `managedKnowledgeBaseConnectorConfiguration.connectorParameters`
    - `embeddingModelType: CUSTOM` pinned to `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0`,
      `FLOAT32` (upper-case: that is the service-model enum value), 1024 dimensions
    - `mediaExtractionConfiguration.imageExtractionConfiguration.imageExtractionStatus
      = ENABLED` — opt-in, and silently indexes no chart or image content if left
      default
    - `dataDeletionPolicy = RETAIN` at creation, the documented remedy for the
      `DELETE_UNSUCCESSFUL` state already present in the dev account
    - _Requirements: 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8_

  - [x] 8.3 Implement managed retrieval
    - New `backend/src/apis/shared/kb_backend/managed_backend.py`
    - Use `managedSearchConfiguration` with `numberOfResults=5` and
      `rerankingModelType="MANAGED"`; never send `vectorSearchConfiguration`, which
      is rejected outright for managed knowledge bases
    - Do not attempt to configure hybrid search; it is not toggleable
    - Constrain any isolation-critical filter to `equals` or `in`
    - Run synchronous boto3 calls off the event loop
    - _Requirements: 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.5, 3.1, 20.7_

  - [x] 8.4 Implement direct ingestion and document delete
    - `IngestKnowledgeBaseDocuments` batched at **10 documents maximum**,
      server-enforced; the user guide's claim of 25 does not apply to managed
      knowledge bases
    - `customDocumentIdentifier = document_id`, which retires the
      `{doc_id}#{chunk_index}` scheme including `delete_vector_tail` and the
      chunk-shrinkage stash on this path
    - Never call `StartIngestionJob` — 0.1 RPS account-wide and not adjustable
    - Bound concurrency against the 10-per-account concurrent document-operation
      limit
    - _Requirements: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6_

  - [x] 8.5 Write unit tests with stubbed AWS APIs
    - Stub `bedrock-agent` and the agent runtime client; never call live
    - Cover create/ingest/delete idempotency, the 10-document batch boundary,
      retryable embedding-verification failure, and `clientToken` length ≥33
    - File: `backend/tests/shared/test_managed_kb_backend.py`
    - _Requirements: 24.2, 24.11_

  - [x] 8.6 Write test for crash between AWS create and record update
    - Simulate a crash after `CreateKnowledgeBase` returns but before the
      conditional update; verify the record remains a discoverable retry anchor and
      that a retry does not create a second knowledge base
    - _Requirements: 7.8, 24.3_

- [x] 9. Ingestion control plane
  - [x] 9.1 Implement the ingestion consumer
    - New `backend/src/apis/app_api/kb_migration/ingestion_consumer.py`
    - Follow `kb_sync/records.py`'s raw-table-access convention: importing
      `apis.shared.assistants` drags in the whole embeddings stack, and keeping the
      Lambda image small is a deliberate constraint
    - Resolve each document's knowledge base and engine, then route legacy
      documents to the existing pipeline and managed documents to direct ingestion
    - Never index the same document on both backends outside a deliberate migration
      or pilot
    - Poll until **actually retrievable**, recording `indexedAt` and
      `retrievableAt` as two distinct timestamps
    - Update `DOC#` to a terminal state with bounded retries and a durable retry
      anchor
    - No in-process `asyncio.ensure_future` orchestration
    - _Requirements: 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5, 10.6, 10.7, 10.8_

  - [x] 9.2 Write unit tests for routing exclusivity
    - Legacy document routes to the old pipeline only; managed document routes to
      direct ingestion only; neither is double-indexed
    - ⚠️ **This was only half true when first marked done.** Every test covered the
      consumer standing down for a legacy document; nothing asserted the LEGACY
      pipeline stands down for a managed one, and it did not — so managed documents
      were double-indexed and both pipelines wrote `DOC#` status. Closed properly by
      PR #900; see `HANDOFF.md` §5.32 and §5.34. A suite can be thorough about the
      side that works.
    - File: `backend/tests/lambdas/test_kb_ingestion_consumer.py`
    - _Requirements: 10.3, 10.4, 10.5_

- [x] 10. Deletion sagas and reconciler
  - [x] 10.1 Implement tombstones
    - New `backend/src/apis/shared/kb_backend/tombstones.py`
    - Write `KBTOMB#{app_kb_id}` (and the `#DOC#{document_id}` variant) **before**
      calling AWS; clear only after AWS confirms absence
    - No TTL on tombstones — TTL removal would recreate the silent-leak class this
      design exists to close
    - Verify knowledge base deletion by polling `ListKnowledgeBases` until the name
      disappears, tolerating ≥6 minutes; deletion took 2–6 minutes when measured
    - Never delete the service role until all of its knowledge bases are confirmed
      absent, and never delete the last KB_Record before AWS confirms
    - Surface `DELETE_UNSUCCESSFUL` as an actionable operator state
    - _Requirements: 13.1, 13.2, 13.3, 13.4, 13.5, 13.6, 13.7, 13.8_

  - [x] 10.2 Implement the daily reconciler
    - New `backend/src/apis/app_api/kb_migration/reconciler.py`
    - Join paginated, tag-filtered `ListKnowledgeBases` against KB_Records
    - AWS-only ⇒ orphan, deleted only if the **AWS-reported `createdAt`** is >24 h
      old; age-gating on discovery time would make a reconciler that was down for a
      week delete every in-flight create
    - Record-only ⇒ mark `vectorState: missing` and **never** delete the record;
      the documents are still valid
    - Both ⇒ refresh `storedBytes`
    - Ship in **report-only** mode, which logs intended deletions and deletes
      nothing; arming is a separate flag that treats an empty string as off
    - Apply a bounded per-run action limit
    - _Requirements: 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.4, 14.5, 14.6, 14.7, 14.8, 19.7_

  - [x] 10.3 Write reconciliation tests
    - Record-only and AWS-only outcomes; age-gate honours AWS `createdAt` rather
      than discovery time; report-only performs no deletes
    - File: `backend/tests/lambdas/test_kb_reconciler.py`
    - _Requirements: 24.4_

- [x] 11. Authorization, isolation, and publication
  - [x] 11.1 Resolve access before retrieval
    - In the facade, resolve the invoking user's access to the knowledge base
      **before** attempting retrieval, reusing the existing assistant permission
      model rather than introducing a parallel one
    - Because this phase holds `App_KB_Id == assistant_id`, "can this user invoke
      this agent" already answers "may this turn retrieve"; do not build for the
      0..N case, which is F4's problem
    - _Requirements: 25.1, 25.2, 25.3_

  - [x] 11.2 Keep filters out of the tenant boundary
    - Do not use a metadata filter as the isolation mechanism; the per-knowledge-base
      boundary is the tenant boundary in this phase
    - Do not adopt ACL-aware retrieval: its identity is email-only with no alias
      resolution and mismatches fail silently, which is a worse primitive than an
      explicit app-side check on an OIDC claim-mapped platform
    - _Requirements: 25.4, 25.5, 11.5_

  - [x] 11.3 Apply resource policies for shared knowledge bases
    - Where a knowledge base is shared beyond its owner, attach a resource policy
      granting IAM-enforced `bedrock:Retrieve`
    - Re-apply the policy whenever a new `awsKbId` is produced; policies attach to
      the AWS ARN, so a replacement silently drops sharing
    - _Requirements: 25.6, 25.7_

  - [x] 11.4 Preserve published-agent semantics
    - An engine migration must not change what a published agent retrieves; parity
      is the contract, so a swap is not a corpus change and needs no re-review
    - Exempt listed agents' knowledge bases from lifecycle reclaim; `taken_down`
      requires an explicit transition rather than falling through
    - Do not attempt to resolve corpus-revision pinning; it belongs to the
      marketplace spec
    - _Requirements: 25.8, 25.9, 25.10, 25.11_

  - [x] 11.5 Write authorization tests
    - Viewer can read through the agent but never sees the upgrade control; a user
      with no access never reaches retrieval; access checks fail closed
    - Published-agent corpus behaviour and reclaim exemption
    - Resource policy is re-applied after a new `awsKbId`
    - _Requirements: 24.6, 24.12, 24.14_

  - [x] 11.6 Write test asserting the 1:1 binding freeze
    - Assert an explicit `knowledge_base` binding is still rejected by
      `binding_validation.py` and that `bindable_catalog.py` still returns an empty
      list for it, so the freeze is enforced by test rather than by intention
    - _Requirements: 6.7, 6.8_

- [x] 12. Dual-read pilot
  - [x] 12.1 Implement opt-in dual read
    - In the facade, when a knowledge base is flagged for the pilot, run both
      backends for the same query and **serve legacy**
    - Record per read: overlap in returned `document_id` values, a rank
      correlation, and per-backend latency
    - Default off; must not increase user-visible latency beyond the legacy path's
      own latency
    - _Requirements: 18.1, 18.2, 18.3, 18.4, 18.5_

  - [x] 12.2 Write dual-read tests
    - Legacy results are always the ones served; comparison metrics are emitted;
      a managed-side failure does not fail the turn
    - File: `backend/tests/shared/test_kb_dual_read.py`
    - _Requirements: 18.2, 18.5_

- [x] 13. Migration dispatcher and worker
  - [x] 13.1 Implement the dispatcher
    - New `backend/src/apis/app_api/kb_migration/dispatcher.py`, following
      `kb_sync/dispatcher.py`
    - Query the sparse `KbWorkIndex`, apply a bounded per-tick dispatch limit
      (mirroring `KB_SYNC_DISPATCH_LIMIT`, default 20), and no-op entirely when the
      migration flag is off
    - _Requirements: 19.6, 15.14_

  - [x] 13.2 Implement the migration worker state machine
    - New `backend/src/apis/app_api/kb_migration/worker.py`
    - `shadow`: provision, then re-ingest every `complete` document from its
      existing S3 key at `assistants/{assistant_id}/documents/{document_id}/{filename}`
      — never ask the user to re-supply anything
    - `verify`: compare an exact source manifest of `document_id` + content hash or
      generation, **not** document-count parity, then run a canary retrieval
    - `promote`: single conditional write of `retrievalEngine="managed"`, only after
      a converged catch-up pass **and** only once the Byte_Cap is enforced on this
      knowledge base — no traffic is promoted to an unmetered corpus
    - `retain`: set `retainUntil` at least 30 days out
    - Take a lease so one knowledge base is never migrated by two workers
    - _Requirements: 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4, 15.5, 15.6, 15.7, 15.8, 15.9, 15.11, 15.13, 12.9_

  - [x] 13.3 Implement catch-up convergence
    - Snapshot the doc-id set, migrate, then run catch-up passes until a pass finds
      nothing new — the same converge-on-quiet shape as the crawler's
      consecutive-miss rule
    - Re-read each document's `DOC#` record immediately before ingesting and skip it
      if gone or no longer `complete`, so a document deleted mid-migration cannot
      resurrect
    - Do not implement dual-write; one write path stays authoritative until
      promotion
    - _Requirements: 16.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.4, 16.5, 16.6_

  - [x] 13.4 Implement rollback
    - Write `retrievalEngine` back to its prior value and stamp `rolledBackAt`;
      move no data
    - Available for the entire `retain` window; a pre-promotion failure leaves the
      knowledge base on legacy and fully usable
    - _Requirements: 17.1, 17.2, 17.3, 17.4, 17.5_

  - [x] 13.5 Write property test for migration idempotency
    - **Property 6: interrupted migration converges without duplication**
    - Using `hypothesis`, for any interruption point in the state machine, verify a
      resumed run reaches the same terminal state, creates exactly one knowledge
      base, and ingests each document at most once
    - **Validates: Requirements 15.9, 15.10, 15.13, 7.4**
    - File: `backend/tests/property/test_pbt_kb_migration_convergence.py`

  - [x] 13.6 Write tests for interference during migration
    - Upload during migration is picked up by catch-up; delete during migration
      never resurrects; concurrent promotion attempts yield one winner
    - File: `backend/tests/lambdas/test_kb_migration_worker.py`
    - _Requirements: 16.2, 16.4, 16.5, 24.5_

  - [x] 13.7 Write test for resource-policy re-application after rehydration
    - A rehydration producing a new `awsKbId` re-applies the resource policy;
      policies attach to the AWS ARN, so a new id otherwise silently drops sharing
    - _Requirements: 24.12_

  - [x] 13.8 Write test for mixed old/new deployment
    - Old and new code serving simultaneously; a record with no `retrievalEngine`
      resolves to legacy under both
    - _Requirements: 1.6, 24.8_

- [ ] 14. Surfaces, observability, and teardown
  - [x] 14.0 Register the managed backend in the resolver
    - **Spec gap, found during implementation.** `register_backend` was defined in
      task 4.2 and called by nothing; task 8.3's note that it would register the
      managed backend was never carried out, and no other task picked it up. Every
      group could therefore have been completed with the feature unreachable: a
      promoted record raises `BackendUnavailable`, which is a correct fail-safe and
      a useless signal — visible only to the single migrated user.
    - Registered at **import** rather than by a startup call, so there is no
      sequence to remember and no service that can come up half-configured. Free
      because both adapters' module bodies are stdlib-only and their clients are
      lazy, which `test_kb_backend_boundary.py` now asserts for `managed_backend`
      too.
    - Does **not** make the feature live: nothing resolves to managed until a
      record says so, and only a promotion writes that.
    - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.5_

  - [x] 14.1 Emit EMF metrics
    - Alongside the existing PromptCache metrics: `KbCount`, `KbStorageGB`,
      `KbIdleGB`, `KbOrphansFound`, `KbQueryClamped`,
      `KbStatusFilterFailClosed`, and
      `KbMigration{Started,Promoted,Failed,RolledBack}`
    - Compute idleness as `max(own lastRetrievedAt, max(lastUsedAt) over bound
      agents)`, never retrieval alone, or an actively used agent's knowledge base is
      evicted because its queries did not match
    - Write `lastRetrievedAt` through a throttled conditional write (one winner per
      24 h), never per retrieval; prefer per-knowledge-base `Invocations` from
      `AWS/Bedrock/KnowledgeBases` where sufficient — that is a *read* of Bedrock's
      own namespace and needs `cloudwatch:GetMetricData` /
      `GetMetricStatistics` (Req 20.13). Our own metrics above publish to
      `${prefix}/ManagedKb` (Req 20.10), never into an `AWS/...` namespace
    - _Requirements: 22.1, 22.2, 22.5, 22.6, 22.8, 20.13_

  - [x] 14.2 Document cost attribution
    - Record that Managed KB bills under `AmazonBedrockAgentCore` and that queries
      must filter on `usagetype` — keying on `AmazonBedrock` misses it entirely, and
      keying on service code alone blends it into the AgentCore Runtime memory line
    - _Requirements: 22.7_

  - [x] 14.3 Build the upgrade UX
    - In `frontend/ai.client/src/app/knowledge-base/knowledge-base-section.component.ts`,
      add the opt-in upgrade card, non-blocking progress, one-time success notice,
      and a failure state with a retry control
    - Show nothing at all for a legacy knowledge base needing no action
    - Never use the word "vector" in user-facing copy
    - Gate on the existing `_require_edit_permission`; viewers never see the control
    - Angular signals, `OnPush`, Tailwind utilities, both light and dark modes,
      WCAG AA
    - **Spec gap, found during implementation.** This task was written as
      frontend-only, but **nothing enrolled a knowledge base**. The worker picks
      up records already in `shadow`; the dispatcher sweeps GSI7; no code path
      wrote either. Group 14 could have been called complete with the feature
      still unreachable. Required a new HTTP surface:
      `backend/src/apis/app_api/kb_upgrade/` (`models.py`, `service.py`,
      `routes.py`) — `GET`/`POST` `…/knowledge-base/upgrade`, `POST …/retry`,
      `POST …/notice`.
    - Kept in its **own package**, not `app_api/kb_migration/`: that package's
      modules share one size-constrained Lambda image, and this one imports
      `apis.shared.assistants` for the permission model, which pulls the
      embeddings stack at module scope.
    - Enrolment is **two conditional writes**, not one put. `KbRecord.to_item`
      does not write `GSI7_PK`/`GSI7_SK` — only `set_migration_state` maintains
      them — so the obvious one-put enrolment produces a record that claims to be
      migrating and is invisible to the dispatcher *forever*, behind a spinner
      that never moves. Asserted by
      `test_enrolment_writes_the_dispatcher_work_keys` and
      `test_the_created_record_does_not_claim_to_be_migrating`.
    - The **offer is gated on `MANAGED_KB_MIGRATION_ENABLED`**, the dispatcher's
      own flag, read at call time with the same allow-list. Offering an upgrade
      the worker cannot perform is a spinner with no engine behind it, so
      "available" is made to mean actionable. Off ⇒ phase `none` ⇒ renders
      nothing, which is also 23.1's required behaviour.
    - Two public transitions added to `kb_backend/records.py`:
      `retry_from_failed` (one atomic write — generation bump, re-enter `shadow`,
      work keys, `REMOVE migrationError`; guarded on the old generation **and**
      still being `failed`) and `dismiss_upgrade_notice`.
    - Client (`kb-upgrade.service.ts`) **fails soft**: `getStatus` resolves to
      phase `none` rather than rejecting, so a broken upgrade endpoint cannot take
      down the documents section it decorates.
    - _Requirements: 23.1, 23.2, 23.3, 23.4, 23.5, 23.6, 23.7, 23.8_

  - [ ] 14.4 Surface failed and stuck documents — **surfacing done, one-click
        retry deferred** (still open: see the deferral note below)
    - During the upgrade flow, list any non-`complete` document that will not be
      carried across and offer retry; 200 of 1,692 production `DOC#` records
      (11.8%) are affected, including 95 `failed` whose owners believe the uploads
      worked
    - Distinguish an unsupported file format from a processing failure in messaging
    - **Done:** `classify_document` splits `unsupported_format` /
      `processing_failure` / `being_removed` / `still_processing` (Req 21.4), and
      the card discloses them collapsed above the offer — *before* the user
      commits, so the choice to fix or accept the loss is theirs (Reqs 21.1, 21.3).
    - The unsupported-format set is **imported** from
      `docling_processor.DOCLING_SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS`, never copied. A copied
      list is the tag-contract defect's exact shape. Its module scope is
      stdlib-only, so the import is free.
    - `deleting` documents are **deliberately surfaced**, though
      `list_assistant_documents` filters them out as soft-deleted: they are 101 of
      the 200 affected records, and a user never shown them cannot tell they are
      stuck. That filter — plus its stale-document auto-fail *write* — is why this
      surface runs its own raw `DOC#` query.
    - **Deferred, Req 21.2 (one-click retry).** Ingestion is S3-event-triggered
      (`documents/ingestion/handler.py`) and no reprocess endpoint exists, so a
      retry control needs new backend that re-fires that pipeline for bytes
      already in S3. Not built: it is a change to a live ingestion path and was
      explicitly deferred rather than improvised. The card currently directs the
      user to re-upload via "Add files", which is a retry path that works today
      and needs nothing new. **Close this subtask by either building the
      reprocess endpoint or amending Req 21.2 to accept re-upload.**
    - _Requirements: 21.1, 21.3, 21.4 (21.2 partial — see above)_

  - [ ] 14.5 Build the admin surface
    - Knowledge bases filterable by engine, with stored bytes and document counts,
      bulk migrate, and per-knowledge-base retry
    - _Requirements: 23.9_

  - [x] 14.6 Extend teardown for runtime-created resources
    - In `scripts/teardown/destroy.sh`, list and delete only knowledge bases tagged
      for the project and environment, **before** deleting their service role and
      the platform stack
    - Poll until each resource is confirmed absent; "delete call accepted" is not
      "resource gone"
    - _Requirements: 20.8, 13.4, 13.5_

  - [x] 14.7 Write teardown test
    - Only tagged resources are deleted, and the service role is deleted only after
      all its knowledge bases are confirmed absent
    - _Requirements: 24.9_

- [ ] 15. Pre-promotion verification
  - [ ] 15.1 Run the packaged-SDK contract probe
    - Using the checked-in environment with **no** `AWS_DATA_PATH` override, run a
      create → ingest → retrieve smoke probe against dev-ai
    - This is the contract test that the pinned `boto3==1.43.68` and its packaged
      service model are genuinely sufficient, rather than the side-loaded model the
      evaluation used
    - _Requirements: 8.1, 9.1, 11.1_

  - [ ] 15.2 Probe for an account-level ingestion-concurrency limit
    - During the pilot, run a many-knowledge-base backfill to determine whether an
      account-level ingestion-concurrency limit exists; the quota page lists none
    - Do not size a wide fleet migration before this is answered
    - _Requirements: 9.5_

  - [ ] 15.3 Confirm the full test matrix passes
    - Run the backend suite, the infrastructure suite, and `mypy`/`ruff` inside the
      dev container
    - Verify every Requirement 24 item has a corresponding passing test
    - _Requirements: 24.1, 24.2, 24.3, 24.4, 24.5, 24.6, 24.7, 24.8, 24.9, 24.10, 24.11, 24.12, 24.13, 24.14, 24.15_

- [ ] 16. Post-implementation findings (opened by running it — see `HANDOFF.md` §5)

  - [x] 16.1 Resolve the 2,000-character context cap on the managed path
    - **RESOLVED 2026-09-04 (Option A: engine-aware cap).** `rag_service.resolve_context_cap`
      returns 2,000 for legacy, 8,000 for managed, keyed on the same `resolve_engine_for`
      the backend resolver uses. Both call sites (`inference_api/chat/routes.py`,
      `app_api/assistants/routes.py`) pass it. Requirement 3.2 amended; out-of-scope
      note updated. Guard in `tests/shared/test_kb_backend_parity.py`, mutation-tested
      (dropping the managed branch fails two named tests). Measured end-to-end on a
      prod-derived KINES advising corpus re-created in dev (`ast-1d51df6ea532`): at
      2,000 the model described 1 of 4 emphasis areas from the docs and guessed the
      rest; at 8,000 all four came from the documents. Branch `fix/kb-managed-context-cap`.
    - **The most consequential open item.** Bedrock's chunks are ~3× Docling's, so
      only ~1 chunk clears the cap and four of reranking's five results never reach
      the model. Measured: legacy 388/130/1035/106 chars (4 fit) vs managed
      1111/1091/1151/1197 (1 fits). Produced a materially wrong answer — a Major
      Core course described as an elective, because the surviving chunk had lost its
      section header.
    - **Not a constant bump.** The cap is a parity control (§9, §13.5), so changing
      it for both backends forfeits attributability. Either accept a managed-only
      cap and declare the asymmetry, or re-run the §13.6 experiment on a corpus
      where the interpreting context sits OUTSIDE the top chunk — which is the case
      §13.6 did not cover.
    - Amend Requirement 3.2 with whichever is chosen (the exclusion note already
      carries the contradicting measurement).
    - _HANDOFF §5.40 · Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

  - [x] 16.2 Understand diagram answer quality before promising anything
    - Column-structured diagrams yield confident wrong answers: a curriculum
      flowchart reported 11 credits where the chart says 19, invented a course from
      an adjacent column, and missed four others. Correctness depends on which
      column a box occupies and chunks carry no coordinates.
    - Image extraction genuinely works (§5.35) — an image-only PDF that legacy
      cannot ingest at all becomes retrievable. The capability is real; precise
      tabular answers from it are not established.
    - **RESOLVED (2026-09-08).** Re-measured on the live diagram corpus
      (`ast-1a90784a7f18`, `4-yr-flowchart-v2026.pdf`) with both read-only harnesses:
      legacy returned 0 chunks on every query (image-only PDF unusable on legacy),
      managed returned 5. The vision narrative loses the column binding — the
      header-only chunk carries no courses, the course chunks carry no semester — so
      a per-column question ("semester 4?") is answered confidently wrong (14 credits
      vs the chart's 19; the mis-columned `ENGR 220` persists). Raising the cap
      2,000→8,000 (task 16.1) did NOT fix it. Existence questions ("does it include a
      capstone?") are correct at both caps.
    - **Decision: no code fix.** A text sidecar would work (managed ingests whatever
      lands in our S3 data source, and a text table keeps its structure), but this is
      a self-service platform — users create their own agents and would not know to
      convert a document. The mitigation is user training/guidance on which content
      and agent types work best, not engineering. Demo image extraction as
      *retrievable where previously impossible*, never as precise per-column answers.
    - _HANDOFF §5.41_

  - [x] 16.3 Make the document-status filter fail closed on its one open path
    - **RESOLVED (§5.33).** `_filter_vectors_by_document_status`'s `if not doc_ids:
      return vectors` now fails closed: a non-empty batch where no chunk carries a
      `document_id` returns `[]` and emits `METRIC_STATUS_FILTER_FAIL_CLOSED`, like
      every other unprovable path. An empty input stays an empty result with no
      metric (an ordinary "no match", not a degradation). Guard
      `test_filter_fails_closed_when_no_chunk_carries_a_document_id` in
      `tests/shared/test_search_filtering.py`, mutation-tested (reverting to
      `return vectors` fails it). Branch `fix/kb-status-filter-fail-closed`.
    - `_filter_vectors_by_document_status` opens with `if not doc_ids: return
      vectors`. Every other unprovable path in that function returns `[]` and emits
      `METRIC_STATUS_FILTER_FAIL_CLOSED`. Predates this feature; not firing today.

  - [x] 16.4 Give the UI one vocabulary and show which engine served a query
    - **RESOLVED (task 16.4).** Two surfaces, one source (the server-derived
      engine on the upgrade status). (1) **Status vocabulary** is now
      engine-aware: `KnowledgeBaseSectionComponent.statusLabel` reads
      `uploading → processing → ready` (+ `failed`) for a managed knowledge base
      and keeps `uploading/chunking/embedding/complete/failed` for legacy
      assistants, which still emit them. Fixes the card showing `Uploading` for
      the whole managed indexing wait (managed writes only `uploading` then
      `complete`, PR #900). (2) **Engine visibility**: `rag_service`'s facade
      logs exactly one INFO line per query naming the served engine
      (`engine=managed (Managed)` / `engine=s3vectors (Classic)`), read from the
      same KB_Record `resolve_backend` uses so it cannot disagree; and a
      `Managed`/`Classic` badge renders beside the document list, fed by a new
      `engine` field on `UpgradeStatusResponse` (defaults `classic`,
      absence-means-legacy). Mutation-tested guards in
      `tests/shared/test_kb_backend_parity.py` (log line + content),
      `tests/routes/test_kb_upgrade.py::TestEngineBadge`,
      `kb-upgrade.service.spec.ts` and
      `knowledge-base-section.component.spec.ts`; no user-facing string says
      "vector" (Req 23.6). Branch `feat/kb-engine-visibility`.
    - Document status is now written only by the owning engine (PR #900), so the
      legacy `chunking`/`embedding` words never appear for a promoted knowledge
      base — but nothing replaced them, so the card shows `Uploading` for the whole
      indexing wait. Agreed shape: `uploading → processing → ready` (+ `failed`),
      with `chunking`/`embedding` retained for legacy assistants, which still emit
      them.
    - Nothing logs WHICH engine served a retrieval — the resolver only logs on
      failure — so "is the new one working?" is answerable only from the KB record.
      One INFO line in the facade, plus a `Managed`/`Classic` badge.
    - Wanted before a wide rollout, because this feature's entire risk profile is
      silent regressions.
    - _HANDOFF §6_

  - [ ] 16.5 Reconcile documents whose ingestion event was dead-lettered
    - A document whose event dead-letters is stranded: `status` is written only by
      the consumer, so nothing ever revisits it even when the content is sitting in
      the knowledge base, fully retrievable. Two such documents occurred in dev and
      both needed manual repair.
    - Overlaps task 14.4 (one-click retry) and the report-only reconciler, which
      already knows how to join Bedrock's view against ours.
    - **Backend built (report-only), branch `feat/kb-deadletter-reconcile`.**
      `kb_migration/document_reconciler.py` is the missing second writer of `DOC#`
      status: once a day it finds rows stuck non-terminal (`uploading`/`chunking`/
      `embedding`) past a 60-minute grace gate, asks Bedrock the ground truth per
      document, and — the §5.37 case — drives a stranded-but-**retrievable** document
      to `complete`. It reuses the consumer's own probes (`document_status`, the
      `equals`-on-`document_id` retrievability search, its status-set constants, and
      `set_document_terminal`) so §5.37/§5.38/§5.39 live in one place, not four. A
      `FAILED` document is driven to `failed`; a `NOT_FOUND` one (dead-lettered before
      ingest) is **re-ingested** from the S3 bytes — the scheduled form of 14.4's
      one-click retry. Modelled on `reconciler.py`: **ships disarmed**
      (`MANAGED_KB_DOC_RECONCILER_ARMED`, empty ⇒ off), per-run action limit applies
      in both modes so the report is trustworthy, grace gate is a pure function of the
      row's own `updatedAt` and fails closed. `terminal`/`deleting` rows are never
      candidates (a soft-deleted doc must not be resurrected). Guards in
      `tests/lambdas/test_kb_document_reconciler.py`, mutation-verified (neutering the
      retrievability gate fails `test_indexed_but_not_retrievable_is_left_short_of_complete`;
      widening `NON_TERMINAL_STATUSES` fails `test_terminal_and_deleting_rows_are_never_candidates`).
    - **Remaining (deploy-gated follow-up, not in this PR):** wire the reconciler's
      own Lambda + EventBridge schedule + IAM in `kb-migration-construct.ts`, then set
      and eventually flip `MANAGED_KB_DOC_RECONCILER_ARMED`. The flag is exempted in
      `test_kb_migration_env_contract.py`'s `OPTIONAL_OVERRIDES` until that wiring
      lands.
