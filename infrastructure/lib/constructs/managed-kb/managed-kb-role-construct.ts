 *
 * WHY `bedrock:StartIngestionJob` IS HERE WHEN NOTHING CALLS IT.
 * It looks wrong, and removing it is the obvious "cleanup". It is not.
 * `IngestKnowledgeBaseDocuments` is *authorized* under the adjacent
 * action name `bedrock:StartIngestionJob` — AWS's own direct-ingestion
 * prerequisites list both in one statement

 *
 *   AccessDeniedException ... not authorized to perform:
 *   bedrock:StartIngestionJob on resource: knowledge-base/XXXXXXXXXX
 *
 * This is NOT a contradiction of Requirement 9.2, which forbids
 * *calling* `StartIngestionJob` (0.1 RPS account-wide, one document
 * every ten seconds). `managed_backend.py` never calls it and must
 * never start; the grant is about authorization only.
 *
 * Same failure shape as the missing `bedrock:TagResource` — an
 * adjacent action AWS checks separately, so the grant reviews as
 * complete and dies on first real use. Found exactly that way: a
 * document uploaded to a promoted knowledge base in dev went to
 * `failed` with the message above, while the local driver's broader
 * SSO identity had been masking it.
 *
 * `bedrock:ListKnowledgeBaseDocuments` is in AWS's example policy and
 * deliberately omitted: no code path calls it, and the docs permit
 * omitting actions. A future caller fails loudly rather than silently.
 *
 * Also intentionally unattached for now — wired in task 2.1 alongside
 * the migration Lambdas, via
