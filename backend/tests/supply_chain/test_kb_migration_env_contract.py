"""The migration Lambdas' environment contract, across Python and TypeScript.

Every environment variable the four handlers read must actually be set by
`kb-migration-construct.ts`, and the construct must not publish
kb-migration-specific variables nothing reads.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS

The feature shipped four wiring mismatches of the same shape — code that reviews
cleanly, deploys cleanly, and does nothing:

1. `register_backend` was defined and called by nothing, so a promoted record
   raised `BackendUnavailable`.
2. Nothing wrote a record into `shadow`, so the worker and dispatcher were both
   correct and inert.
3. `MANAGED_KB_MIGRATION_ENABLED` was set on the Lambdas but not on the App API
   task that gates the upgrade offer, so the card rendered nothing anywhere.
4. The construct set `MANAGED_KB_WORKER_FUNCTION_NAME` while the dispatcher read
   `KB_MIGRATION_WORKER_FUNCTION_NAME`. Every tick raised
   `RuntimeError: KB_MIGRATION_WORKER_FUNCTION_NAME is not set` and no knowledge
   base could ever migrate. Its sibling `KB_SYNC_WORKER_FUNCTION_NAME` works
   precisely because `kb-sync.test.ts` asserts it.

The tag-contract tests already do this for tag *keys*. This does it for the
environment, which is the other half of the same seam: two files in two
languages that must agree on a string, with nothing but a schedule to tell you
they don't.
