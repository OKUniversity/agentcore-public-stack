"""Every module a Lambda handler can import must actually be in its image.

The app-api / inference-api images COPY all of `backend/src`, so their
import graph is trivially satisfied. The three Lambda images do NOT — each
COPYs a hand-maintained subset of `apis.shared` to keep the image small.
That subset was a manual list with nothing keeping it in sync with the
code, and it drifted twice over:

* `apis/shared/timestamps.py` was introduced in 8544d87a and imported by
  `documents/ingestion/status.py`; neither Dockerfile.rag-ingestion nor
  Dockerfile.kb-sync copied it. Document ingestion and KB sync ran at a
  100% error rate in dev and prod for days. Nothing surfaced it — the SPA
  just showed crawled documents sitting at `uploading` forever.
* `document_service.soft_delete_document` imports `apis.shared.assistants`
  inside a `try/except ImportError` that logs "boto3 is required" and
  returns None. In the kb-sync image that except branch was always taken,
  so the worker's miss-eviction path silently no-opped.

Those two failure modes are why this test does NOT distinguish
module-level imports from function-local ones. A function-local import
still executes when its function is called — `handler.py` reaches
`status.py` exactly that way — and a *swallowed* one is worse than a
crash, because it degrades quietly. The invariant is simply: if a module
is reachable from an entrypoint's import graph, the image must contain
it.

The cost of being complete is bounded — these are leaf-ish helper modules
whose own dependencies (stdlib, boto3, pydantic) are already pinned in
each image's requirements. If a genuinely heavy module ever shows up
here, the right fix is to stop importing it from a Lambda path, not to
weaken this test.
