"""Agent Marketplace Phase 8 — problem reports (D15).

These run against a real (moto) table with the sparse GSI6, because the properties worth
testing are all properties of the *keys*, not of the Python:

* **The queue is sparse, not filtered.** A resolved report leaves the admin queue by
  losing its index key. A test that asserted on a filtered list would still pass if
  someone replaced the sparse write with a state filter — and would then miss the day a
  reader forgot the filter.
* **One open report per reporter (D15.4).** Enforced by three conditional writes on a
  deterministic key. Every case below is a way that can silently become "stacks a second
  report", which is the failure that makes the queue floodable and the nav count
  meaningless.
* **Reports are child rows that never outlive their Agent.** An orphaned *open* report
  keeps its index key, so it would sit in the queue forever pointing at nothing.
