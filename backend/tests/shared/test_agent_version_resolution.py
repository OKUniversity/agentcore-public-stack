"""Which Agent configuration a caller runs (version-snapshots §4).

This is the payoff of the epic and the place a regression would be quietest: getting it
wrong does not raise, it just serves the wrong instructions to somebody. So the cases are
enumerated against a real (moto) table rather than a mocked repository — the resolution
depends on a stored version actually being readable, and a mock would assert only that we
called it.

The one that matters most is ``test_a_pinned_user_runs_the_snapshot_not_the_draft``. That is
the exposure from §1 of the spec, at the layer where it actually bit: not the store tile
being stale, but a pinned user's turn running rewritten instructions.
