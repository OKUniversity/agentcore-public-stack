"""
Dual-read pilot: legacy serves, managed is observed, nobody waits.

Requirement 18. The pilot's value depends entirely on it being safe to leave
switched on, so the tests here are mostly about what it must *not* do.

The load-bearing one is latency (18.5). Managed ``Retrieve`` measured a
662–695 ms p50 against legacy's 257 ms, so a pilot that awaited both would nearly
triple the retrieval leg of every piloted turn — and it would do so while
producing correct results and passing every other test in this file. It is caught
here by making the managed backend sleep far longer than any test tolerance and
asserting that the facade still returns promptly, which fails if the two calls
are ever gathered instead of detached.

Feature: managed-kb-migration
Requirements: 18.1, 18.2, 18.3, 18.4, 18.5
