"""Slash-command skill invocation (`/skill-name` in the composer).

Two halves, both in inference-api chat routes:

* ``_resolve_invoked_skill_slugs`` — narrow-never-grant, the same rule
  ``_apply_enabled_skills_filter`` applies to ``enabled_skills``, re-run
  against the turn's FINAL effective set because an Agent's skill bindings can
  replace that set after the first filter runs.
* ``_build_skill_invocation_note`` — the directive appended to the user
  message. A slash command has to be expressed as an instruction because the
  only activation path is the plugin's own ``skills`` tool, which the model
  calls.
