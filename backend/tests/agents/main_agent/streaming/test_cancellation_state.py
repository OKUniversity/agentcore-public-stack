"""Cancellation must stop the running turn — and only the running turn.

Two defects live here, and they pull in opposite directions.

**Cancel was too weak.** ``_mark_session_cancelled`` only flipped
``session_manager.cancelled``, which StopHook reads at *tool boundaries* and the
stream coordinator reads *between stream events*. Neither regains control while
an MCP ``tools/call`` is in flight, so a Stop pressed during a slow MCP call ran
that call to completion. strands-agents 1.51.0 forwards the agent's cancel signal
into the in-flight MCP call and makes the sequential executor skip the tools
queued behind it, so ``agent.cancel()`` now closes that gap.

**Cancel was too sticky.** Neither flag was ever reset. The agent cache keys on
session id and hands the *same* ``Agent`` — and the same
``TurnBasedSessionManager`` — to the next turn (#741/#751), so one Stop left the
session permanently cancelled: every subsequent tool cancelled at its boundary,
every message dropped by ``append_message``, and the coordinator raising
``_CooperativeStopSignal`` on the first event of a turn the user never stopped.
Strengthening the first defect without fixing this one would have widened it.

The SDK-contract tests at the bottom exist because both fixes depend on private
Strands internals that a future pin could drop silently. A stub would keep
passing; these bind against the installed SDK so the regression surfaces here.
