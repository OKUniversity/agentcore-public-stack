"""Backfill: stamp GSI5PK/GSI5SK on tool-catalog rows written before they existed.

``ToolDefinition.to_dynamo_item`` began stamping EntityTypeIndex keys in
``perf(tools): index the tool catalog so listing it stops scanning`` — every
tool row written before that carries neither attribute:

    tool row : PK=TOOL#{tool_id}  SK=METADATA
             + GSI5PK=ENTITY#TOOL
             + GSI5SK=TOOL#{tool_id}

``EntityTypeIndex`` is **sparse**: DynamoDB indexes a row only if it carries
the index's key attributes. A row missing them is not "stale" in the index, it
is *absent from it forever* — and the omission is silent, no error anywhere.
Switching ``list_tools`` to that index without this backfill would serve an
empty (or partial) tool catalog to every user on the deployment, which reads
as "all my tools disappeared", not as an outage anyone gets paged for.

WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL
----------------------
The app-roles table is shared. Tools, skills, roles, role grants, JWT mappings
and one tool-preferences row PER USER live in it, so listing tools by Scan
reads the whole table and filters. Scan cost tracks table size, not result
size — measured on dev, 95 items read to return 24 tools, 17 of them per-user
rows. That read's cost therefore grows with enrollment rather than with the
number of tools. The index turns it into a Query on one partition.

RUN THIS BEFORE THE INDEX IS CREATED, IF YOU CAN
------------------------------------------------
DynamoDB backfills a new GSI at creation time from rows that already carry its
keys, so stamping first means the index is complete the moment it reports
ACTIVE, with no partially-populated window. The attributes are inert until an
index consumes them, so running early costs nothing.

Running *after* creation is also fine and is the expected order here, because
the CDK change and this script ship in the same PR: the index simply picks up
each row as this script stamps it. Either way the rule that matters is the
same — **do not switch the read to the index until this reports
``skipped=0 failed=0`` and the index item count matches the tool count.**

SAFETY
------
* **Dry-run by default.** Pass ``--apply`` to write.
* **Idempotent.** Guarded by ``attribute_not_exists(GSI5PK)``, so a second run
  finds nothing and a row the writer has since stamped is left alone.
* **Never resurrects a deleted row.** ``attribute_exists(SK)`` on every update.
* **Touches only tool metadata rows.** ``TOOL#``/``CAPABILITIES`` snapshots,
  skills, roles and user preferences are left alone — they are not tools, and
  the tool partition of the index must contain exactly the tool catalog.
* **Invents nothing.** Both key values derive from the row's own PK, so a
  stamped row is byte-identical to what the writer would have written.

Run from the repo root, against dev first, then prod. The interpreter is the
backend venv's, not the system ``python`` — this script needs ``boto3``, and a
bare ``python`` fails with ``ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'boto3'``
(hit for real during the v1.21.0 prod run). Nothing here imports ``apis.*``, so
the venv's interpreter is the only requirement; ``uv run --project backend
python …`` works too::
