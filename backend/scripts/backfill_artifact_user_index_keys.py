"""Backfill: stamp GSI2PK/GSI2SK on artifact HEAD rows written before they existed.

The artifact writer began stamping user-index keys on HEAD rows in
``feat(artifacts): stamp user-index keys on HEAD rows ahead of the index``
(2026-09-04). Every HEAD row written before that carries neither
attribute:

    HEAD row : PK=USER#{user_id}  SK=ARTIFACT#{aid}#HEAD
             + GSI2PK=USER#{user_id}
             + GSI2SK=ARTIFACT#{updated_at}#{aid}

``UserArtifactsIndex`` is **sparse**: DynamoDB indexes a row only if it
carries the index's key attributes. A row missing them is not "stale" in
the index, it is *absent from it forever* — and the omission is silent.
Switching the library's user-wide listing to that index without this
backfill would drop every artifact created before 2026-09-04 from the
page, with no error anywhere.

RUN THIS BEFORE THE INDEX IS CREATED
------------------------------------
DynamoDB backfills a new GSI at creation time from rows that already
carry its keys. Stamping first therefore means the index is complete the
moment it reports ACTIVE, with no window in which it is partially
populated. The attributes are inert until an index consumes them (no
index write is charged), so running early costs nothing.

WHAT IT DOES NOT TOUCH
----------------------
``updated_at``. It is not a display field: HEAD's ``GSI1SK``/``GSI2SK``
embed it, and only the writer maintains it. This script *reads* it to
build ``GSI2SK`` — matching byte-for-byte what the writer would have
written — and never assigns it. Same restraint as
``ArtifactLifecycleService.rename``.

Version rows are skipped by design. The keys belong on HEAD rows only,
so the index holds one row per artifact rather than one per version.

SAFETY
------
* **Dry-run by default.** Pass ``--apply`` to write.
* **Idempotent.** Guarded by ``attribute_not_exists(GSI2PK)``, so a
  second run finds nothing and a row the writer has since stamped is
  left alone.
* **Never resurrects a deleted row.** ``attribute_exists(SK)`` on every
  update, matching the writer's own write-back rule.
* **Encodes a missing ``updated_at`` rather than inventing one.** Such a
  row is stamped with an empty timestamp segment
  (``ARTIFACT##{aid}``), which sorts below every real timestamp and so
  reads last — where the previous in-memory sort put it. Leaving it
  unstamped would drop the artifact from a sparse index, and from its
  owner's library, silently.
