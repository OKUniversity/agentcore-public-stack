"""Request/response models for the artifacts API.

Covers the render-token, session-list and content endpoints, plus the
artifact-sharing surface (`artifacts/shares.py`).

JSON casing is split by design and matches what already shipped: the
render-token / list / content models are snake_case (this domain's
original REST shape), while the sharing models are camelCase aliases to
mirror the conversation-sharing API the SPA share modal is adapted from.
