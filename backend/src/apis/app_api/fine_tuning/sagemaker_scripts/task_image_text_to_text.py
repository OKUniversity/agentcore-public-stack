"""Generative vision-language fine-tuning: (image, prompt) -> free text.

The three classification tasks all end in a softmax over a fixed class list.
This one does not: the model keeps its language-modelling head and learns to
*write* the response, so the dataset has no label column and the result file
carries a text column instead of one probability column per class.

**Why LoRA and not a full fine-tune.**  A generative VLM worth using starts
around 7B parameters and the catalog goes to 34B.  A full fine-tune needs
roughly 16 bytes per parameter once gradients and the AdamW moments are
resident — ~550GB for a 34B model, against the 384GB on the largest instance
we offer.  Quantising the frozen base to 4-bit and training only low-rank
adapters brings the same model to ~18GB of weights, which fits one 48GB card
and leaves the activations room to breathe.  The trade is that the artifact is
an *adapter*, not a model: it is a few hundred MB rather than 69GB, and
inference reloads the base from the Hub and applies the adapter on top.

**Prompt masking.**  Loss is computed on the response only.  Training on the
prompt as well is the usual accident here: the model spends most of its
gradient budget learning to reproduce questions it will always be given.  The
prompt length is measured by rendering each record twice — once with the
generation prompt and no answer, once complete — and masking that many leading
positions.
