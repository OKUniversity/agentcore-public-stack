"""Task-type registry for the fine-tuning feature.

A *task type* bundles everything that varies between one kind of fine-tuning
job and another: what a training record looks like, how the dataset is
packaged for upload, which HuggingFace auto-class loads the model, which Deep
Learning Container it runs in, and what the inference output looks like.

Before this module existed those answers were hardcoded inline in ``train.py``
and ``inference.py``, which is why adding a second modality meant a rewrite
rather than a registration.

**This module must stay importable without torch, transformers, pandas or
PIL.**  It is imported three different ways:

* by ``routes.py`` in the app-api container, to validate a job *before* it is
  submitted and a GPU is billed;
* by the training and inference scripts running inside the SageMaker DLC;
* by the unit tests, which run in the backend venv where the ML stack is
  absent.

Keep it pure data and stdlib.  The same reasoning already governs
``DATASET_READERS`` in the training script: the supported-format contract has
to be assertable without importing pandas.
