"""SageMaker instance pricing and capability map for fine-tuning.

Rates are **us-west-2 on-demand USD/hour**, taken from the AWS Price List API
(``aws pricing get-products --service-code AmazonSageMaker``), filtered to the
``Training`` and ``BatchTransform`` components.  They are not from the pricing
web page, which rounds and lags.

Two things this module gets right that a single flat map could not:

1. **Training and Batch Transform are priced separately.**  They agree across
   the g5 family but diverge on g6e (e.g. ml.g6e.24xlarge is $18.83/hr to
   train and $18.8319875/hr to transform), and some instances are offered for
   one and not the other at all.
2. **Not every training instance can run Batch Transform.**  ml.p4d.24xlarge
   and ml.p5.48xlarge publish a Training rate and no BatchTransform rate — an
   inference job on one is rejected by AWS.  Absence from
   :data:`TRANSFORM_COST_PER_HOUR` is how we refuse it before billing.

``ml.p3.*`` is deliberately absent: the Price List API returns no on-demand
SageMaker rate for that family in us-west-2 at all, so the three entries this
map used to carry priced instances a job could never actually provision.
``ml.p4d.24xlarge`` and ``ml.p5.48xlarge`` are also left out — they train but
cannot Batch Transform, so offering them would let a researcher fine-tune a
model they then have no way to run inference on.  Add them only alongside a
non-Batch-Transform inference path.

Pricing accuracy is now load-bearing rather than cosmetic: the monthly quota
is denominated in dollars, so a wrong rate does not just misreport spend, it
mis-enforces the budget.  Re-run ``backend/scripts/refresh_instance_pricing.py`` to
resync after an AWS price change.
