"""HTTP surface for the owner-facing knowledge base upgrade (Requirements 21, 23).

Four endpoints, all under the assistant that owns the knowledge base:

* ``GET  /assistants/{id}/knowledge-base/upgrade``          — what to render
* ``POST /assistants/{id}/knowledge-base/upgrade``          — opt in
* ``POST /assistants/{id}/knowledge-base/upgrade/retry``    — after a failure
* ``POST /assistants/{id}/knowledge-base/upgrade/notice``   — dismiss the notice

Permission is resolved the same way the documents surface resolves it, through
``resolve_assistant_permission``. The read is allowed for any resolvable
permission and reports ``canUpgrade: false`` to a viewer; the three writes
require owner or editor. Requirement 23.7's "viewers never see the control" is
therefore enforced on the server, with the client's hiding as presentation only.
