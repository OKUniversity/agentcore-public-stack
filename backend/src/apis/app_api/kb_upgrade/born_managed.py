"""Born-managed: stack knowledge-base provisioning onto the FIRST document upload.

``MANAGED_KB_NEW_DEFAULT`` (rollout ladder step 2) makes a new agent's knowledge
base managed from the start. This module is the API-side half — the trigger — and
:mod:`apis.app_api.kb_migration.provisioner` is the worker-side half that does the
minutes-long work.

Why the first upload, and not agent creation
--------------------------------------------
Three reasons, in order of how much they cost if ignored:

1. **Quota.** Managed is one Bedrock knowledge base per agent against a ~10,000
   per-account ceiling. Provisioning at agent creation spends that budget on
   prompt-only agents and abandoned drafts — agents that will never hold a
   document. Provisioning at first upload bounds it to agents that actually use
   RAG.
2. **WYSIWYG.** The agent-creation page uploads documents to the *draft* and lets
   the author test against them on the spot. Provisioning at first upload means
   the engine they test on is the engine they ship.
3. **Nothing to migrate.** A brand-new agent has no corpus, so there is no
   shadow-index-and-verify to run. Trying to reuse the migration for this — which
   an earlier revision of this feature did — writes ``retrievalEngine=managed``
   only at *promotion*, so the very first document is grabbed by the legacy
   pipeline, tested on legacy, and then indexed a second time on managed.

Which is why this declares the engine **up front**: the legacy handler skips a
document only when its record already resolves to ``managed``
(``documents/ingestion/handler._resolve_engine``). Declaring first is what makes
the first document go straight to the managed pipeline instead of both.

What this function must never do
--------------------------------
Fail an upload. Provisioning is an optimisation of *which engine* serves a
knowledge base, never a precondition for storing a document, so every failure
path here is logged and swallowed and leaves the agent on legacy — exactly where
it would have been without this feature. The one thing the caller learns is
whether to label this document ``provisioning``.

It also never blocks. The AWS ``CreateKnowledgeBase`` call is 47–124 s to
``ACTIVE`` and takes minutes end to end; all this does is three conditional
DynamoDB writes and hand the job to the dispatcher's queue.
