"""Enrolment and status for the owner-facing knowledge base upgrade.

Three things happen here and nothing else: derive what the card should show,
move a record into ``shadow``, and dismiss the one-time success notice. Promotion
belongs to the worker, after verification — this module never writes
``retrievalEngine``, so no HTTP request can put a knowledge base on the managed
backend without the corpus having been carried across and checked first.

Enrolment is deliberately two conditional writes rather than one put:

1. ``create_provisioning`` — guarded on ``attribute_not_exists(PK)``.
2. ``set_migration_state(SHADOW, ...)`` — guarded on the generation.

A single ``put_item`` with ``migrationState="shadow"`` baked in would look
simpler and would be **wrong**: ``KbRecord.to_item`` does not write the
``GSI7_PK``/``GSI7_SK`` work keys, which only ``set_migration_state`` maintains.
The record would exist, claim to be migrating, and be invisible to the
dispatcher's sparse-index sweep forever.
