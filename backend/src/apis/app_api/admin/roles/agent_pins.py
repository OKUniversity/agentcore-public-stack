"""Admin API for a role's default pinned Agents (Marketplace D9, D10 — Phase 6).

Mounted under ``/admin/roles/{role_id}/agent-pins`` because **the AppRole record is the
source of truth** (CLAUDE.md's RBAC rule). If an Agent-side "which roles pin this?" picker
is ever added, it must write *through* to each role's pin items and derive the field back
on read — the ``set_roles_for_skill`` pattern — never a role list persisted on the Agent,
which would silently grant nothing.

Two things this surface must keep saying out loud:

**⚠️ ``default`` is a substitute, not a baseline (D9.6).** ``resolve_user_permissions``
consults the ``default`` role only when the user matched *zero* AppRoles, and never merges
it alongside a matched role. Pins seeded there reach only users who match nothing else — in
prod, close to nobody. ``fallbackOnly`` on the response is what lets the console say so
instead of letting an admin assume it means "everyone". ``unmapped`` is the same warning
for any role that carries no ``jwtRoleMappings`` at all.

**Removing a role pin unpins for everyone who had not pinned it themselves (D9.1).** Pins
resolve live; there is no fan-out and no "new members only". The console's removal dialog
has to say that plainly.

**Locking is bounded by friction, not by a cap (#748).** A locked seed cannot be dismissed
by the member who receives it, and an admin weighing "seed" against "seed locked" otherwise
has no reason not to lock. ``lockedElsewhere`` on the response tells the console how many
locked seeds other roles already hold, because a user's shelf is the *union* across every
role they match and a lock from any one of them wins. That union cannot be capped: role
membership resolves per user from Entra claims, so it is not knowable at write time, and
enforcing it at read time would silently drop an admin's lock for some users.
