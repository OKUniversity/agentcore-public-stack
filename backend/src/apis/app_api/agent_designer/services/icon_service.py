"""Agent Marketplace Phase 4 — the icon upload / read / remove paths (D5).

Authorization for an Agent's square icon, and the one place the three storage concerns
meet: validation (``apis.shared.assistants.icons``), the object write (S3), and the
``iconKey`` attribute write (``listing_repository.write_icon_key``).

Two authorization rules, and they are deliberately different from each other:

* **Writing an icon is editing the agent.** Owner *or* editor, matching ``PUT /agents/{id}``
  — an icon is presentation, not behavior, and an editor who may rewrite the instructions
  is not someone to stop at the avatar. (Admins reach the same field through D13's
  ``PATCH /admin/agents/{id}/listing``, which is a separate path with its own audit trail.)
* **Reading an icon follows the shelf, not the record.** A published agent's icon is
  readable by any authenticated user, because the store read already hands that agent's
  name, tagline and emoji to every browsing user — the icon is no new disclosure, and
  gating it on the record's own access check would render a broken image on the shelf of
  any published agent whose ``visibility`` is still PRIVATE.
