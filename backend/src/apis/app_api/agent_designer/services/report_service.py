"""Problem reports — the user's half and the admin queue (D15, Phase 8).

Two surfaces over ``apis.shared.assistants.reports``, which owns the storage:

* **A user reports a published Agent.** Gated on reachability *and* publication (D15.3):
  you may report what the store offered you. Reporting a ``private`` or ``in_review``
  Agent is not a thing — nobody outside the author was invited to it, and a takedown is
  not available as a remedy for something that was never listed.

* **An admin triages.** The reporter is visible here and nowhere else (D15.2), and a
  decision writes only the report (D15.5).

⚠️ **A report is not a permission signal and not a ranking input.** Nothing in this module
touches ``usageCount``, the store front, or any ordering, and no count it produces is ever
returned on a user-facing read. The moment report volume influences placement, reporting
becomes a way to bury a competitor's Agent.
