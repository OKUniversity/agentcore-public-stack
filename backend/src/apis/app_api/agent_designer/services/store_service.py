"""Agent Marketplace Phase 2 — the browse read (D4, D10).

The user-facing half of the marketplace. Everything here reads the sparse GSI5 index and
projects into ``AgentListingResponse``, which carries icon, name, tagline, publisher and
category — and nothing else.

Two properties are worth stating because they are easy to erode later:

* **The query cannot return an unpublished agent, or unapproved content.** Not because it
  filters, but because the GSI5 key lives on the published ``VERSION#`` snapshot: an
  unpublished agent has no key, and an author's draft edits are not in the indexed row at
  all. Any future change that starts filtering ``listing.state`` in here is a sign the
  index has stopped being sparse, which is a bug in the write path, not something to
  compensate for on read.
* **The store read never carries behavior.** No ``instructions``, no binding refs, no
  owner id. ``AgentResponse`` exists for the surfaces that legitimately need those; the
  shelf is seen by every browsing user and gets the narrowest projection that renders.
