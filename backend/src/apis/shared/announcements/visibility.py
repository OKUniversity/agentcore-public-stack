"""Who sees which announcement — the whole of it, in one pure function.

Spec §D5: **the server computes visibility, the client renders what it is
handed.** The alternative — ship every announcement plus the ack list and
filter in the SPA — puts these rules in two languages, lets them drift, and
leaks announcements to users who were never targeted.

So this module is deliberately dependency-free: no DynamoDB, no FastAPI, no
clock of its own. It takes the announcements, the user's roles, the user's
acks, and `now`, and returns exactly what the response should contain. That
makes the rules table-testable without moto, which is the point — this is
where the logic lives, so this is where the tests are.
