"""Per-process TTL caches over the tool catalog.

Three caches live here, all backed by DynamoDB reads of the tool
catalog:

1. **Per-tool freshness tokens** (`get_tool_updated_at`,
   `get_freshness_hash`). Cheap change-detection signal for the agent
   and MCP-client caches: any admin edit to a tool bumps its
   `updated_at`, so including the freshness hash in a cache key causes
   the next build to miss and rebuild with the fresh config.

2. **All-known-tool-ids snapshot** (`get_all_tool_ids`). The set of
   tool IDs known to the catalog — the source of truth for the
   "universe of tools" that authorization (`ToolAccessService`) needs
   to enumerate. Wildcard-access users in particular need this to know
   which tools to expand `*` into, and to validate requested tools
   against.

3. **Public-tool-ids snapshot** (`get_public_tool_ids`). The set of
   tool IDs flagged `isPublic` in the catalog — "available to every
   authenticated user regardless of role". `AppRoleService` unions this
   into a caller's role grant so the access *checks* honour the same
   flag the tool *picker* already does (see the module note there).

Reads are TTL-cached so the per-turn overhead is bounded to at most
one DynamoDB read per cache key per TTL window, per process. Admin
routes call `invalidate(tool_id)` after a write so same-process
visibility is immediate; other processes see the change within one
TTL window. `invalidate` clears the id snapshots too, since any
create/delete shifts those sets — and toggling `isPublic` on an
existing tool shifts the public one.
