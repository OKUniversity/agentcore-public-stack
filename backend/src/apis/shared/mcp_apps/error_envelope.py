"""Carry an app-tool error across the AgentCore Runtime boundary.

inference-api runs behind AgentCore Runtime, which rewrites **any** non-2xx
container response to a generic ``424``::

    {"message": "Received error (409) from runtime. Please check your
     CloudWatch logs for more information."}

Both the status *and* the human-readable message are destroyed. So an
app-initiated `tools/call` that needs OAuth consent — which
`dispatch_app_tool_call` reports as a deliberate 409 carrying "Connect the
account, then try again" — reached the SPA as a 424 whose body told the user
to go read CloudWatch logs. Verified live on dev 2026-09-08.

The fix: inference-api answers **200** with the error in the body instead,
and app-api translates it back to the real HTTP status before replying to
the SPA. The SPA's contract is unchanged — it still sees 403 / 409 / 502
with ``{"error": "<message>"}`` — so only the one hop that crosses AgentCore
changes shape.

**Never widen `_RELAYABLE_STATUSES` to include 401.** The SPA's
`error.interceptor` treats any 401 as an expired BFF session and redirects
to login, so relaying a 401 here would sign the user out over an unconnected
connector.
