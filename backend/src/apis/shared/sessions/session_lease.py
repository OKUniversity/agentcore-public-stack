"""Per-session single-flight lease (distributed concurrency guard).

Closes the server-side race where two concurrent ``POST /invocations`` for the
same session run two agent loops against one AgentCore Memory session and
corrupt tool-pairing history (see docs/specs/session-single-flight-guard.md and
PR #653). A client-side abort does not propagate through the AgentCore Runtime
data plane, and the Runtime can route the duplicate to a *different* container,
so an in-process lock is insufficient — we need a distributed lease.

Design:
- A dedicated item on the existing ``sessions-metadata`` table
  (``PK=USER#{user_id}``, ``SK=LEASE#{session_id}``). The deterministic key
  means acquisition is one atomic conditional write with no GSI read first.
- ``leaseExpiresAt`` (epoch seconds) is the application-level validity check
  used in the acquire ``ConditionExpression``; the ``ttl`` attribute is only a
  coarse DynamoDB auto-reap backstop for crashed-container orphans (TTL delete
  lags up to 48h and must never be the correctness mechanism).
- Renewal (heartbeat) and release are owner-scoped so a container that already
  lost the lease can neither extend nor delete the new owner's lease.

Fail-open: every operation except a genuine lock *conflict* proceeds/degrades
silently. A throttle or transient DynamoDB error must never block a legitimate
turn — the guard is a safety net, not a gate.
