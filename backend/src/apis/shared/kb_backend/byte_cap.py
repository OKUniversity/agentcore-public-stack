"""Per-owner byte cap accounting for managed knowledge bases.

Managed storage is billed at $5.00/GB-month, roughly 35x what S3 Vectors costs
today. At the measured average of 1.13 MB per user that is about $169/month across
the fleet — but nothing structural stops one user uploading far more, and 30,000
users at 100 MB each would be 3 TB, or about $15,000/month. The cap is what turns
"unlikely" into "impossible".

Why an accumulator instead of the obvious condition
---------------------------------------------------
The natural way to express this is::

    ConditionExpression="storedBytes + reservedBytes + :n <= :cap"

**DynamoDB rejects that.** Condition expressions compare operands; they cannot do
arithmetic. Verified directly: the parser fails with ``Cannot parse condition
starting at:+ reserved <= :cap``.

So the arithmetic is moved to the client, where it is free. A single
``totalBytes`` accumulator is maintained as the invariant
``totalBytes == storedBytes + reservedBytes``, and the guard compares it against a
**literal computed before the call**::

    ADD totalBytes :n, reservedBytes :n
    CONDITION totalBytes <= :max_before      where :max_before = cap - n

That is a single atomic conditional update, so N concurrent reservations cannot
collectively overshoot. The alternative — read, compute, write — has a window
between the read and the write in which another writer commits, which is exactly
the race a cap exists to prevent.

Reserve / commit / release, not just "add"
-----------------------------------------
Ingestion is not instantaneous: a 50 KiB PDF measured 68-264 seconds. Counting
bytes only on success would let a user start unlimited concurrent uploads that are
each individually under the cap and collectively far over it. So bytes are reserved
up front, converted to stored on success, and returned on failure. A crash between
reserve and commit leaks a reservation, which is the safe direction — it
under-permits rather than over-permits, and the reconciler can recover it.

Sizing
------
Size always comes from an S3 ``HEAD`` on the stored object, never from a
client-reported value: a client that under-reports its own size would defeat the
cap entirely. Bedrock's ``RawDataSize`` metric is deliberately **not** used for
enforcement — it returned 0 datapoints for a directly-ingested document during
evaluation and remains unconfirmed. Enforcing against a metric that is sometimes
absent would fail open.

Import weight
-------------
Module-level imports are stdlib only; ``boto3`` is function-local, so this module
can be imported into a size-constrained Lambda image for free.
