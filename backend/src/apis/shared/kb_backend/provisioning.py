"""Lazy provisioning of a Managed Knowledge Base, and its CUSTOM connector.

A knowledge base is created in AWS the first time a document is actually ready to
be indexed — never when an assistant is created (Requirement 7.1). Creation was
measured at 47–124 s to ``ACTIVE`` (n=7), so this never sits on an interactive
path, and every call here is issued off the event loop (Requirement 20.7).

Order of operations, which is the whole design
----------------------------------------------
The KB_Record is written in ``provisioning`` **before** the first AWS call and the
returned identifiers are attached afterwards with a conditional update
(Requirement 7.3). Reversing those two steps looks harmless and is not: a crash
between ``CreateKnowledgeBase`` returning and the record being written would leave
a billed AWS resource that no record points at and no code can find. Nothing
raises, nothing alarms, and the only evidence is the invoice.

Written record-first, the same crash leaves a ``provisioning`` record that is a
durable **retry anchor** (Requirement 7.8): the Reconciler can match it against
the orphan and adopt it, and a plain retry of this function reuses the persisted
``clientToken`` so AWS deduplicates rather than creating a second knowledge base.

Four details that are each a defect if omitted
----------------------------------------------
1. **The ``clientToken`` is built, not interpolated.** The API's minimum is **33
   characters** — verified in the packaged service model, ``ClientToken`` has
   ``min: 33``, ``max: 256``, ``pattern: [a-zA-Z0-9](-*[a-zA-Z0-9]){0,256}``. The
   natural ``{id}-{variant}-kb`` template is 31 characters and fails *client-side*
   validation, before a request is ever sent. :func:`build_client_token`
   constructs one that cannot be too short, and :func:`validate_client_token`
   refuses one that is.

2. **"Unable to verify the specified embedding model" is retryable.** It was
   observed against a model confirmed ``ACTIVE`` and directly invokable: it is IAM
   eventual consistency, not a configuration error. Treated as fatal, lazy
   provisioning fails intermittently while pointing at the wrong cause — an
   operator reads the message and goes to check the model.

3. **``dataDeletionPolicy: RETAIN`` at creation.** The documented remedy for the
   ``DELETE_UNSUCCESSFUL`` state, which the dev account has already been sitting
   in since 2025-11-24. Set deliberately up front, not as incident response.

4. **``imageExtractionStatus: ENABLED``.** Opt-in. Left at its default, chart and
   image content is never described and never indexed — a silent loss of a
   capability being paid for, with no error anywhere.

Why ``storageConfiguration`` is absent
--------------------------------------
There is no vector store to provision: that is the point of a managed knowledge
base. Sending ``storageConfiguration`` at all is rejected (Requirement 8.2), so it
is omitted entirely rather than passed empty.

Reconciling "``managedKnowledgeBaseConfiguration={}``" with the embedding pin
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirement 8.1 records that ``managedKnowledgeBaseConfiguration`` has **no
required members**, so ``{}`` is a valid value. Requirement 8.5 separately pins
``embeddingModelType: CUSTOM`` to ``amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0`` at float32 and
1024 dimensions. Those are not in conflict: the packaged service model puts
``embeddingModelType`` / ``embeddingModelArn`` /
``embeddingModelConfiguration.bedrockEmbeddingModelConfiguration`` inside
``managedKnowledgeBaseConfiguration`` as optional members, so the pin goes there.
It is pinned rather than left to the service default because the choice is
**immutable after creation** (Requirement 8.8) and because keeping today's Titan
v2 embedding preserves continuity with the legacy corpus.

Import boundary
---------------
Module-level imports are stdlib plus this package's own stdlib-only modules.
``boto3`` is imported inside the function that builds a client, so importing this
module into a size-constrained Lambda image costs nothing. See
``tests/architecture/test_kb_backend_boundary.py``.

    NO EMBEDDING PIN. Requirement 8.5 originally pinned
    ``amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0`` via ``embeddingModelType: CUSTOM``, and that
    was carried over from the legacy path without re-deriving it. It does not
    apply here, for two independent reasons:

    1. **The pin protected a failure mode that cannot occur in managed mode.** On
       S3 Vectors *we* embed the user's question (``s3vectors_backend`` calls
       ``apis.shared.embeddings``), so the query model must match the model that
       indexed the documents or the similarity search compares vectors from
       different spaces. Managed retrieval sends ``retrievalQuery={"text": ...}``
       and ingestion sends ``inlineContent`` text — we never produce a vector, so
       Bedrock embeds both sides itself and consistency is the service's
       invariant, not ours to get wrong.
    2. **AWS refuses the pin together with managed reranking.** Measured, both
       ways::

           CUSTOM  + rerankingModelType=MANAGED -> ValidationException
           CUSTOM  + NONE                       -> ok, scores 1.0/0.982/0.952 (flat)

           default + NONE                       -> ok

       The evaluation recorded the pin as worth nothing measurable ("identical
       answer quality — 9/9 either way") and reranking as worth a lot ("the
       reranker is what makes a small context cap defensible"). Given they are
       mutually exclusive, keeping reranking is the side with evidence behind it.

    The choice is immutable per knowledge base, which is why it is argued here
