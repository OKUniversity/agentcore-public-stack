"""User pin state for the Agent Marketplace (D8, D9 user side — Phase 5).

A pin is a **pointer, never a fork** (D8). Agents are addressable by id and already run
for anyone with access, so there is nothing to install: "Add to my agents" stores an id.
Forking would duplicate the record (version drift the moment the author updates) and
re-owner the bindings, which silently breaks Skills v2 invoke-through in the confusing
direction.

Storage is one item per user on the **user-settings** table, following the established
``USER#{id}`` + uppercase-semantic-SK convention (``SETTINGS``, ``TOOL_PREFERENCES``):

    PK = USER#{user_id}, SK = "PINNED_AGENTS"
    { pinned: [ { agentId, order, pinnedAt } ], dismissed: [ agentId, ... ] }

Two properties worth stating because both are easy to erode:

**1. ``dismissed`` is written from Phase 5, before anything reads it.** Role-seeded pins
(D9, Phase 6) are resolved live rather than materialized, so a seeded pin the user removed
would re-apply on the very next resolution without a tombstone. Recording the tombstone
now means the resolver that arrives with role pins inherits a real history instead of
treating every existing user as having dismissed nothing.

**2. Pinning clears the tombstone; unpinning writes one.** They are two halves of one
toggle. A user who pins an Agent they previously dismissed has changed their mind, and
leaving the tombstone in place would make a future role seed for that Agent unreachable
forever — the failure being tombstoned exists to prevent, inverted.

The write is a read-modify-write on a single per-user item. Two taps racing can lose one
of them; the cost is a pin the user re-taps, and the alternative (a set-typed attribute
with atomic ADD/DELETE) cannot carry the per-entry ``order`` and ``pinnedAt`` the shelf
sorts and renders by.
