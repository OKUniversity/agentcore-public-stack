"""Role-seeded default pins for the Agent Marketplace (D9 role side — Phase 6).

An admin assigns default pinned Agents per ``AppRole``, so a role's members start with a
useful sidebar instead of an empty one. Storage mirrors the grant items on the **app-roles**
table:

    PK = ROLE#{role_id}, SK = AGENT_PIN#{agent_id}
    { order: int, locked: bool, createdAt, createdBy }

Four properties, each of which the rest of the feature leans on:

**1. ⚠️ A pin is not a permission.** These items share a partition with ``TOOL_GRANT#`` /
``MODEL_GRANT#`` / ``SKILL_GRANT#`` and nothing else. They are deliberately absent from
``AppRole``, from ``EffectivePermissions`` and from ``_compute_effective_permissions``;
they do not inherit through ``inheritsFrom``, and they are resolved by the query below
rather than merged into the permission payload the model call path reads.

**2. They live in their own module for that reason.** The obvious home was
``AppRoleRepository``, which already owns this table — and that is exactly the coupling
worth refusing. Keeping the pin read out of the repository that computes permissions makes
"a pin is not a permission" a structural fact rather than a comment.

**3. Resolution is live, never materialized (D9.1).** There is no fan-out job writing a
row per member. Removing a role pin removes it for everyone in the role who has not
independently pinned the Agent — a real capability loss, taken deliberately in exchange for
an entire asynchronous subsystem and its backfill.

**4. The write is a whole-list replace.** ``order`` is a property of the list, not of any
one row, so per-item saves would let two edits interleave into an order nobody chose.
``createdAt``/``createdBy`` survive the replace for ids that stay, so the audit trail
records when an Agent was *seeded*, not when the list was last dragged around.

    Feeds the admin console's locked-pin friction (D9 open question, #748). A locked seed
    cannot be dismissed by the member who receives it, and an admin choosing between "seed"
    and "seed locked" otherwise has no reason not to lock: locking guarantees the rollout
    lands and the cost falls on someone else's sidebar.

    ⚠️ **This is reported, never enforced, and that is not a shortcut.** Pins merge as a
    union across every role a user holds and a lock from *any* of them wins
    (``pin_service._role_seeds``), so a per-role cap would not bound what any individual
    sees — the case the open question flags. Nor can the union be capped at write time:
    role membership resolves per user from Entra claims, so which roles co-occur on one
    person is not knowable here. Capping at *read* time would be worse still, silently
    dropping an admin's lock for some users. What is knowable on this surface is the
    institution-wide total, so that is what the console shows.

    Costs one query per role. The admin console is low-traffic and an institution has a
    handful of roles, which is the same trade ``list_pins_for_roles`` already makes.
