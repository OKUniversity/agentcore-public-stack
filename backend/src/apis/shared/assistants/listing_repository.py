"""Persistence for the Agent Marketplace ``listing`` block and the sparse GSI5 keys.

This is deliberately a *separate* write path from ``service.update_assistant``, for two
reasons that both bite if ignored:

1. **The generic update cannot own the directory keys.** ``Assistant`` is ``extra="allow"``
   and reads hydrate straight from the raw DynamoDB item, so ``GSI_PK``/``GSI2_SK``/… come
   back as extra model fields and ``_update_assistant_cloud`` re-writes every attribute
   not in its ``immutable_fields`` set. GSI5 is listed there precisely so a routine author
   edit can never resurrect a directory key on a delisted agent. Only this module writes
   them.
2. **Admin edits are not owner edits.** ``update_assistant`` gates on
   ``get_assistant(id, owner_id)``, an ownership check a reviewer fails by definition
   (D13 exists so an admin can fix a tagline without the author). The authorization for
   these writes lives in the service layer, not in an ownership check here.

⚠️ **The store index no longer lives on the Agent row.** It moved to the published
``VERSION#`` item (``version_repository.set_version_index``), because keeping it here meant
the browse query answered from the same record the author edits — an approved listing could
serve rewritten instructions. ``write_listing`` now unconditionally REMOVEs the GSI5
attributes, so the only way onto the shelf is a promoted snapshot. Reason 1 above still
holds and matters more than ever: the generic update path must never resurrect a key here.
