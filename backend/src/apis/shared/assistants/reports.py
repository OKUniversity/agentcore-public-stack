"""Problem reports for the Agent Marketplace (D15, Phase 8).

A report is a **private message to the curator**. It is never rendered to another browsing
user, and nothing derived from it may reach ``usageCount``, the store front, or any
ordering — the moment report volume influences placement, reporting becomes a way to bury
a competitor's Agent. This module therefore has exactly two readers: the admin queue and
the delete path that removes reports along with their Agent.

Storage is child rows under the Agent on the **assistants** table, so a report is deleted
with the Agent it concerns and never outlives it:

    PK = AST#{agent_id}, SK = REPORT#{report_id}
    { reporterId, reporterName, reason, note, state, createdAt,
      resolvedAt?, resolvedBy?, resolutionNote? }

Written only while ``state == "open"``, exactly as GSI5 is written only while published:

    GSI6_PK = "REPORTS#OPEN"   GSI6_SK = CREATED#{created_at}

Four things here are load-bearing:

**1. ⚠️ The sort key is deterministic, not chronological.** The spec sketched
``SK = REPORT#{created_at}#{report_id}``, but that is incompatible with its own D15.4
instruction to enforce one-open-report-per-reporter "with a conditional write on a
deterministic ``report_id``, not a second index": you cannot conditionally update a row
whose key embeds the timestamp you are trying *not* to change without first reading it —
which is the extra lookup D15.4 exists to avoid. So the key is
``REPORT#{sha256(agent_id:reporter_id)}`` and the chronology lives in ``GSI6_SK``, which
is the only place anything actually reads it. Nothing sorts by the table's sort key.

**2. The one-open-report rule is enforced by three conditional writes and no read.**
Create-if-absent, else update-if-open (preserving ``createdAt`` and the index keys, so a
re-report does not jump the queue), else overwrite-if-closed with a fresh ``createdAt``.
Each step is a condition on the item itself, so two taps racing cannot stack two reports
or resurrect a resolved one.

**3. Triage clears the index key rather than filtering on state.** A resolved report
leaves the queue because it has no key, not because a reader remembered to exclude it —
the same physics as the sparse directory index.

**4. Per (agent, reporter), history is one deep.** Filing again after a resolution
replaces the resolved row. An append-only archive was considered and declined: nothing
reads it, and D15.1 already puts the durable record elsewhere — a report is the *evidence*
for a request-changes or takedown, and that act is separately recorded on the listing.
