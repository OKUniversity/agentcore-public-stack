"""The curated store front (Agent Marketplace D10, Phase 5).

    PK = "AGENT_STOREFRONT", SK = "CONFIG"    { featured: [agentId, ...] }

**A single item holding an ordered array**, deliberately unlike categories and publishers
(which are per-item records with an ``order`` field, following ``UserMenuLink``). Two
reasons: the list is short, and reordering has to be atomic — with per-item ``order``
fields a drag that rewrites five rows is five writes and a half-applied order is
reachable. Here the array *is* the order, and one ``put_item`` moves the whole row.

⚠️ **This is the only ranking lever that exists.** ``GSI5_SK`` is ``created_at``, so
everything below the featured row is newest-first; there is no popularity sort and v1
deliberately does not approximate one. Promotion is therefore how a good Agent gets found,
which is exactly why the ordering is admin-owned and explicit rather than derived.

Membership is *not* self-healing here: an id whose listing was later taken down stays in
the array until an admin removes it, and the read paths drop it from what they render.
Pruning on read would quietly rewrite an admin's curation from a GET, and a takedown that
is later reversed would have silently cost the Agent its slot.
