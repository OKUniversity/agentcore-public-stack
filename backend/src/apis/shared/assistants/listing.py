"""Agent Marketplace Phase 1 — the listing state machine and the sparse directory key.

Pure functions over the ``listing`` block on an Agent record. No I/O: the repository
layer (``listing_repository``) turns a validated target state into a DynamoDB write, and
the service layer (``agent_designer.services.listing_service``) owns the authorization
and disclosure rules. Keeping the machine pure is what makes every transition — legal
and illegal — cheap to test.

Two invariants live here, and both are load-bearing:

1. **Publication is an explicit forward act** (spec D3). A record with no ``listing``
   block has never been submitted, and no amount of ``visibility == "PUBLIC"`` creates
   one. ``visibility`` is the access gate; ``listing.state`` is the publication state.
   They are separate axes and this module never reads the former.
2. **The directory index is written only while published** (spec Data model). ``gsi5_keys``
   returns keys for exactly one state, so unpublication is enforced by physics rather
   than by a filter someone can forget: no key, so the browse query cannot return it.

   Version snapshots extend that physics one level. The keys are now written on the
   published ``VERSION#`` row rather than on the Agent row, so the index cannot return
   *draft content* either — not because a reader checks, but because the draft has no row
   in the index. ``gsi5_keys`` is unchanged and still the single derivation; only its
   caller moved (``version_repository.set_version_index``).

#   withdrawal_requested → published        admin declines; the listing stays live
#   withdrawal_requested → taken_down       admin pulls it outright instead
#
# Deliberately absent: anything → published other than from in_review or
# withdrawal_requested. Approval is the only door *into* the store, so a bug elsewhere
# cannot publish by accident; declining a withdrawal is not a new publication, it is a
# refusal to unpublish, and neither is cancelling an update — both return a record to a
# version the store never stopped serving.
#
# ⚠️ ``published → private`` is deliberately GONE. An author could previously pull a live
# listing unilaterally, with no admin ever seeing it — the D2 review queue makes
# publication stop for a human, and unpublication should not be a side door around that.
# Withdrawal is now a request an admin acts on (see §5.1 of the version-snapshots spec).
# The edges an author still owns alone are the ones where nothing is on the shelf:
# ``private → in_review``, withdrawing a *pending* submission
# (``in_review``/``changes_requested`` → ``private``), and shelving one an admin has already
# pulled (``taken_down → private``). None of them removes anything users can currently see.
#
# ⚠️ ``taken_down → private`` was absent, and its absence was load-bearing for nothing.
# The stated reason was audit: the takedown record (``review_note``/``reviewed_by``/
# ``reviewed_at``) lives on the listing block itself, so letting an author reach ``private``
# lets them reach ``delete_assistant`` — which is refused for every state *except* ``private``
# — and take the record with them.
#
# That protection never held. ``taken_down → in_review → private`` was always walkable by the
# author alone (``submit_listing`` then ``withdraw_listing``: after a takedown
# ``published_version`` is cleared, so ``is_on_shelf`` is False and the withdrawal resolves to
# ``private`` immediately rather than to a request). The record was already erasable in three
# author-only steps; all the missing edge bought was that the middle step posted a submission
# to the D2 review queue that the author intended to withdraw a moment later. It taxed admins
# to protect nothing.
#
# So the edge is added and the audit question is named honestly rather than half-defended: if
# a takedown record must outlive the Agent, it needs a row that is not the Agent's own listing
# block, and no arrangement of this table can supply that. What the delete guard actually
# earns — and still earns — is that nothing *live or pending* is ever deleted out from under
# the store: ``published``, ``withdrawal_requested`` and ``in_review`` all still refuse, so
# unpublication stays an explicit act rather than a side effect of a delete.
#
# The edge is safe in the direction that matters. ``private`` is already an author target, and
# ``is_on_shelf`` hardcodes ``taken_down`` to False, so this can never route to
# ``withdrawal_requested`` and can never pull something off a shelf it is not on. Getting back
# *into* the store is unchanged: ``private → in_review → published``, approval still the only
# door.
#
# ⚠️ ``published → in_review`` is how an author ships an UPDATE, and its absence used to make
# a published listing a dead end. Version snapshots mean an author's edits land on the draft
# and reach nobody until a new version is approved, so the only way to get a fix in front of
# users is to submit again — and from ``published`` there was no edge to submit along. The
# author's alternatives were to request withdrawal (taking their own listing off the shelf to
# fix a typo) or to wait for an admin to send it back with ``request_changes``. Neither is a
# thing a working author should have to do, and the second one isn't even theirs to start.
#
# This is not a second door into the store. Submitting an update leaves ``published_version``
# and its index key exactly where they are (``submit_listing``), so the previously approved
# snapshot keeps serving; approval of the new one is still the only thing that changes what
# users get. What it does open is the reverse edge — see ``author_cancel_target``.
#
# ⚠️ ``rejected`` is the answer to a submission that should not be in the store *at all*,
# and it exists because the only two decisions before it were "approve" and "request
# changes". An admin who thought a submission did not belong had to either publish it or
# say "fix this" — which promises a review they do not intend to give, leaves the author
# revising toward an approval that is not coming, and leaves the admin re-reading the same
# submission every time it comes back.
#
# **The difference from ``changes_requested`` is intent, not mechanics, and that is
# deliberate.** Both carry a required reason and both let the author come back
# (``rejected → in_review``). What differs is what the author is told: "I want this, fix
# X" versus "this is not a fit, here is why". Making the second one *terminal* was the
# alternative and it is a much bigger hammer — it needs an appeal path, an admin escape
# hatch, and a policy about who may grant one. None of that is worth building before
# someone needs it, and an honest "no" that the author can answer is worth having now.
#
# It is not a door into the store and cannot become one: the only way back is
# ``in_review``, so approval is still the single edge that publishes. ``rejected → private``
# is the author shelving it, which is what makes it deletable — the same exit
# ``taken_down`` has, for the same reason.
#
# ⚠️ It must also be in ``is_on_shelf``'s never-listed set. A rejected listing has no
# ``published_version`` to clear (it was never published), so a stale pointer is not the
# risk; the risk is the *other* direction — without it, a rejected agent that somehow
# carried a pointer would read as on-the-shelf and route a withdrawal into an admin queue
# for something no user can see.
#
# ⚠️ ``changes_requested`` covers two different listings — one that was never published, and
# one that *was* and is still serving while the author revises it (``review_listing``
# deliberately does not unpublish). Only the first may walk ``→ private`` alone; the second
# has to go through a request, which is why this row carries both exits and
# ``withdraw_listing`` picks between them with ``is_on_shelf`` rather than by state name.
#
# The reason that is safe — and it is the whole reason ``AgentListing.withdrawal_from``
# exists — is that declining a withdrawal returns the listing to the state it came *from*,
# not to a hardcoded ``published``. So ``in_review → changes_requested →
# withdrawal_requested → published`` is not reachable: a listing that entered
# ``withdrawal_requested`` from ``changes_requested`` can only go back to
# ``changes_requested``. Approval remains the only door into the store, and
# ``test_approval_is_the_only_door_into_the_store`` asserts exactly that.

    An author with a live listing who submits an update and then changes their mind is doing

    the shelf" and turns their cancellation into a ``withdrawal_requested`` — a request to
    pull the whole listing, sitting in an admin's queue, when all they wanted was to take
    back an edit. So cancelling an update is its own act, and this is where its target comes
    from.

    **Returns the target rather than checking one.** The caller has no business choosing
    here: the only safe answer is the state the submission came *from*, and a function that
    validated a proposed target would let a caller propose ``published`` for a listing that
    was in ``changes_requested`` — silently discarding an outstanding change request, and
    publishing something no admin approved. That is the identical trap ``withdrawal_from``
    exists to close on the withdrawal path (see ``ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS``), so it is closed the
    same way: record the origin on the way in, and read it on the way out.

    ``in_review → published`` is not a door into the store here for the same reason declining
    a withdrawal isn't: the listing never left. ``submit_listing`` leaves ``published_version``
    and its index key untouched, so this returns the record to what the store was already
    serving. Approval remains the only edge that *changes* what users get.

    ⚠️ Raising when ``submitted_from`` is absent is load-bearing, not defensive. Absent means
    "this submission was not an update to a live listing" — a first submission, or one from
    ``private``/``taken_down`` — and those cancel to ``private`` down the ordinary path. If
