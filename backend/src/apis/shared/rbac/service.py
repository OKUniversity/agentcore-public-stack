"""AppRoleService for resolving and checking AppRole-based permissions.

**A tool is granted by a role grant *or* by its own ``isPublic`` flag.**
Both are real grants and every gate here reads both, via the one
``_tool_grant_set`` helper. They used to disagree: ``isPublic`` was
honoured only by the tool *picker*
(``ToolCatalogService._compute_granted_by``) while the checks below read
role ``grantedTools`` alone, so a public-but-ungranted tool listed for
everyone and then failed at use — silently dropped from a scheduled run,
and a hard block on any Agent that bound it. Non-admins hit it; anyone
holding ``"*"`` never did. Keep the two sides reading the same flag; this
is the tools-axis twin of the ``_grants_access`` consolidation in
``admin/services/model_access.py``.

The public set is *not* merged into ``UserEffectivePermissions``. That
object is per-user cached and its ``tools`` list is order-sensitive
(it reaches the model's ``toolConfig``, where a flip re-writes the
prompt-cache prefix). Unioning at the predicate instead keeps the
catalog's own TTL cache as the freshness boundary for an ``isPublic``
toggle and leaves the cached permission object untouched.

        Resolve effective permissions for a user based on their JWT roles.

        This is the main entry point for authorization checks.

        Algorithm:
        1. Check user cache
        2. For each JWT role, find matching AppRoles
        3. If *nothing* matched, fall back to the ``default`` role
        4. Merge permissions (union for tools/models, highest priority for quota)
        5. Cache and return

        **``default`` is a fallback, not a universal role.** Step 3
        consults it only when the user matched *zero* AppRoles; it is never
        merged alongside a matched role. Prod's ``default`` additionally
        carries no ``jwtRoleMappings`` at all, so granting something there
        reaches only users who match nothing else — never the cohort roles
        (prod: ``faculty``/``staff``/``student``/``demo_day``). Comments
        across this repo previously framed feature GA as "one grant to
        ``default``, no redeploy"; that was wrong and has been corrected.
        Reaching everyone means granting to each cohort role, or changing
        ``default`` to merge as a baseline rather than substitute.

        Related: the admin roles UI builds its ``grantedTools`` control from
        the tool catalog (``admin/roles/pages/role-form.page.ts``,
        ``availableTools()``) with no free-text entry. Anything that is not a
        catalog tool — a feature-capability id, say — therefore cannot be
        granted from the UI at all, only by hand-writing DynamoDB items. That
        is what made the short-lived ``skills`` capability gate inoperable and
        got it removed; weigh it before routing a new grant through this axis.
