"""Workspace tools (list / read / write) over the user-files store.

A generic file surface for the agent: enumerate the user's files, read text
content on demand (bounded), and write text deliverables the user can
download. All storage flows through ``apis.shared.files.workspace`` — the
DynamoDB user-files table is the source of truth, so workspace files appear
in the chat's Files panel alongside uploads.

Design notes
------------
* Identity (``user_id`` / ``session_id``) is captured by closure via the
  ``make_*`` factories — the same pattern as the artifact, spreadsheet, and
  word-document tools (the Strands runtime here does NOT populate
  ``ToolContext.invocation_state`` with identity). The tools are injected
  per-request through ``extra_tools`` (see ``_build_workspace_tools`` in
  ``apis/inference_api/chat/routes.py``); they are deliberately NOT registered
  in ``builtin_tools/__init__`` because they need request-scoped identity.
* Binary files are returned by reference (presigned URL), never base64 — file
  bytes do not flow through the model (token-cost tenet, CLAUDE.md).
* ``workspace_write`` returns the same inline download-card contract as the
  word tool (``ui_type: "file_download"``) so the SPA renders a first-class
  download card.
