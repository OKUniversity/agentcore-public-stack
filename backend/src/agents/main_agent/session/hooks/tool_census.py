"""Hook that tallies tool calls per model call, for the content-free cost profile.

The admin cost console can say what a conversation *cost* down to the model
call, but until now nothing recorded what the user was *doing* in it — which
tools ran, how often, how often they failed. That signal lives only inside
message content, which the console must never read. This hook counts it out
of band: tool name → ``{calls, errors}``, attributed to the model call whose
output requested the tools, and the stream coordinator writes the tally onto
that call's ``C#`` cost row as ``toolCalls`` (the same way ``turnAgentId``
and ``prefixFingerprints`` ride that row).

Tool names are catalog ids and MCP tool names — structural, not content.
Nothing here reads a tool's input or result beyond ``status``.

Attribution uses the same cycle counter ``AgentStatusHook`` uses: ``cycle``
increments on every ``BeforeModelCallEvent``, and a tool that runs during
cycle *N* was requested by model call *N* — the coordinator's ``call_index``
``N-1`` (0-based). ``tally_for_call`` does that translation so the caller
does not have to.

Deliberately **non-drained** (unlike ``AgentStatusHook``, whose lists the
coordinator empties mid-turn): the tally is read once at turn end, per call,
and reset at the next turn's ``BeforeInvocationEvent``. Per-turn state only —
never anything a later turn could inherit (CLAUDE.md: never cache session
state on an agent instance).

Costs nothing against the model: it runs on hook events the loop already
crosses and writes to an in-process dict. Gated by
``COST_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED`` (default on, ``=false`` kill switch); while off
every callback returns immediately and ``tally_for_call`` is always ``None``,
so the row simply has no ``toolCalls`` and the profile reads "not tracked".
