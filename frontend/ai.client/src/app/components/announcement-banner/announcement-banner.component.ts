/**
 * The ambient announcement surface (§D1) — a strip at the top of the shell.
 *
 * At most one is ever shown, and **the server picks which** (§D7: highest
 * severity, then oldest `publishAt`). There is no selection logic here; this
 * renders `bannerItem()` and nothing else.
 *
 * Three things about it are less obvious than they look.
 *
 * **It writes `seen` on render, once per announcement per tab.** That is what
 * clears the unread dot for someone who reads the banner and never opens the
 * panel. The write races the user's click on ✕, which is exactly why §D2 makes
 * the server-side rank monotonic — a late `seen` cannot clobber `dismissed`
 * and bring the banner back. Do not "fix" that race here by delaying or
 * ordering the writes; the guard belongs at the database.
 *
 * **Dismissal is durable, not client-side.** Unlike `quota-warning-banner`,
 * whose dismissal is a `localStorage` "not now" for a signal that recomputes
 * every turn, an announcement is one-shot: dismissing it means never again, on
 * every device (§D3). `AnnouncementsService.ack` still hides it locally when
 * the POST fails, so a transient 500 cannot trap a user under an
 * undismissable strip.
 *
 * **It overlays rather than occupying space.** The host is positioned
 * `absolute` inside the shell's `<main>`, so showing or dismissing it never
 * reflows the page — an earlier version was a flex child, and dismissing it
 * pulled the whole view up by its height. Overlaying also removes the reason
 * three pieces of viewport-fixed chrome used to offset against a measured
 * `--announcement-banner-height`: nothing has to move any more, so that
 * variable, its `ResizeObserver`, and all three offsets are gone.
 *
 * **It lives above the composer, not at the top of the shell.** A deviation
 * from §D1's "strip below the top nav", and a deliberate one: what these
 * announce — a new model, a new capability — is acted on in the composer, so
 * the notice belongs where the decision is made rather than in a corner the
 * eye has already left. It mounts from `chat-input` beside
 * `quota-warning-banner` for that reason, which also means it is a **chat
 * surface only**; What's New remains the everywhere-record, which is why
 * `panel` is forced onto every announcement server-side.
 *
 * **Which side of the composer it takes follows the composer.** In a
 * conversation the composer is pinned to the bottom of the viewport, so the
 * pill goes above it. On the empty state the composer is centred with the
 * greeting directly above it, so the pill goes below instead — otherwise it
 * floats over the greeting, which is exactly what it does at narrow widths.
 * The caller passes `placement`; it is derived from the container's
 * `isEmptyState()`, not measured, because that signal is what decides which
 * layout branch renders in the first place. Measuring viewport position would
 * re-derive the same fact less reliably, and would have to be recomputed on
 * resize, on scroll, and when the artifact pane opens.
 *
 * Either way it floats clear of the quota tabs, which stay visually attached
 * to the input.
 *
 * The wrapper is `pointer-events-none` and only the pill itself takes events,
 * so the full-width positioning strip cannot swallow clicks aimed at the
 * topnav or the sidebar buttons underneath it.
 *
 * Body markdown is deliberately *not* rendered here: this surface is one line.
 * The full body lives in What's New, which is why `panel` is forced onto every
 * announcement server-side.
 *
 * **The text is a button, and clicking it opens the full announcement.**
 * Without it the only affordances on the pill are ✕ and an optional CTA, which
 * trains people to dismiss unread — and What's New, the only other way to the
 * body, is buried in the user menu. It opens the single-announcement dialog
 * rather than the What's New list on purpose: the pill named one thing, so
 * handing back a list to search is a worse answer than the thing itself. From
 * there the dialog owns the ack, and any of its exits retires the pill
 * durably (see `onOpenDetail`).
 *
 * **A `requiresAck` announcement gets no ✕ here.** `dismissed` and
 * `acknowledged` are both at or above `SUPPRESSING_RANK`, and suppression
 * applies to the banner *and* modal slots alike — so with a ✕ on the strip, a
 * user could retire a compliance notice from the pill and the blocking modal
 * would never fire, leaving no `acknowledged` record anywhere. On those, the
 * only way out is to open it and press the button.
