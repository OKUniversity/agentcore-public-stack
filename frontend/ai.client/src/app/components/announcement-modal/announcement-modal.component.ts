/**
 * The interruptive announcement surface (§D1) — a dialog on next load.
 *
 * This is the only surface that can demand a real acknowledgement. When the
 * announcement carries `requiresAck`, **the confirm button is the only exit**:
 * the backdrop-dismiss directive's output is ignored, Escape is swallowed, and
 * the dialog is opened with CDK's `disableClose`. There is no ✕ and no
 * "Later". That is deliberate and it is also the reason `requiresAck` should
 * be rare — see the fatigue note in §11.
 *
 * Without `requiresAck` it behaves like any other dialog: ✕, Escape, backdrop
 * click and "Got it" all converge on the same `dismissed` ack.
 *
 * **Whether this opens at all is not decided here.** `AnnouncementModalService`
 * owns the §D8 turn-safety gate; by the time this component exists, the
 * decision to interrupt has already been made.
 *
 * Markdown renders through `ngx-markdown` **with sanitization on**. Do not add
 * `[disableSanitizer]`: `admin.announcements` is a delegable scope, so this
 * body may be authored by someone who is not a platform admin and it is
 * broadcast to every user (§D10). Body styling uses `.message-block`, the
 * app's real markdown stylesheet — the `prose` classes on the older
 * `user-menu-link-modal` are inert, because the Tailwind typography plugin is
 * not installed.
