 * Feature announcements — the read side and the acknowledgement side.

 * **The server decides what is visible; this service renders what it is
 * handed** (§D5). There is deliberately no targeting, date, or ack filtering
 * here: those rules exist once, in `apis/shared/announcements/visibility.py`.
 *
 * Two pieces of local state exist on top of the server's answer, and both are
 * conveniences rather than truth:
 *
 * - `locallyHidden` implements the **fail-open dismissal** from §D7. If the
 *   ack POST fails, the item is hidden for this tab anyway. A user trapped
 *   under a banner they cannot dismiss because of a transient 500 is a worse
 *   outcome than an announcement that comes back tomorrow.
 * - `locallyRead` clears the unread dot the moment the panel opens, without
 *   waiting for the round trip. The server is still told, and the next fetch
 *   agrees.
 *
 * Neither is ever the source of truth — that is the whole point of §D3.
