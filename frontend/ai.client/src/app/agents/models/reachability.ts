 * "Who can actually open this?" — one sentence, in the one place both surfaces read it from.
 *
 * Publication and reachability are separate axes and the store only guards one: the browse
 * read applies no access check, while the detail read enforces one. So an approved PRIVATE
 * or SHARED Agent gets a shelf tile that 404s for everyone it is not shared with.
 *
 * The author (at submit) and the reviewer (at approve) are the two people who can act on
 * that, and they must not be told two different things — this is the same reason
 * `runnabilityMessage` exists next door.
 *
 * ⚠️ This used to describe publishing a SHARED Agent to a team as legitimate. It is not:
 * the marketplace is public-only, sharing with named coworkers is a separate mechanism,
 * and the backend now refuses anything short of PUBLIC at submit and at approve.
 *
 * So this file is now **reviewer-facing only**. The author never sees these strings: the
 * submit dialog asks them to consent to going public and does it for them. What survives
 * here is the case no submit-time gate can catch — an Agent published as PUBLIC and
 * narrowed afterwards, which is what the reviewer and the admin table need to know about.
