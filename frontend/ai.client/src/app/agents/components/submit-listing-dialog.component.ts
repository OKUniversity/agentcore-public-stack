/**
 * Submit an Agent to the marketplace (D2), with the D7 disclosures.
 *
 * The dialog does not decide anything. It asks `GET /agents/{id}/listing/preflight`,
 * which runs the same checks the transition enforces, and renders the answers:
 *
 * * **Skill exposure (D7.1)** — publishing an Agent effectively publishes the contents
 *   of every skill its author wrote and bound, because Skills v2 resolves a `skill`
 *   binding on `skill.owner_id == agent.owner_id`. The names are listed, not counted.
 * * **Memory spaces (D7.2)** — a `memory_space` binding blocks submission outright, so
 *   the form is hidden and the backend's message (which names the space) explains why.
 *   The author learns this before filling in a category, not after clicking.
 * * **Going public** — the marketplace is public-only, and every Agent starts PRIVATE,
 *   so most first submissions need visibility widened. `makePublic` rides the submit
 *   request and the backend widens in the same write, so the author never leaves this
 *   dialog to change a setting on another screen.
 *
 *   ⚠️ It is a **disclosure, not a checkbox**. It used to be an unticked box that
 *   disabled Submit until ticked, on the reasoning that widening access must be
 *   consented to. The reasoning holds; the control did not serve it. There is no
 *   submission that leaves an Agent private — the store is one public shelf — so the box
 *   had exactly one valid answer, and a required control with one valid answer is
 *   ceremony that trains people to click past it, not consent. What consent actually
 *   needs is that the author *knows*, and that is the notice's job. Pressing "Submit for
 *   review" underneath a notice saying what submitting does is the consent.
 *
 *   The backend gate is deliberately unchanged: `_visibility_block` still refuses a
 *   submission whose request omits `makePublic`, so a direct API caller — who sees no
 *   notice — cannot widen an Agent by accident. This dialog is where the notice is
 *   shown, so this dialog is where the flag is now always set.
