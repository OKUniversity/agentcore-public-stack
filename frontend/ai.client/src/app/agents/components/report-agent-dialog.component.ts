 *
 * The copy carries the one thing the user must not misread: **this is not a review**.
 * There is no rating here and none is coming — feedback is a private message to the
 * people who curate the store, it never appears on the agent's page, and the author never
 * learns who sent it. A user who thinks they are posting a public review will write a
 * different (and less useful) thing than one who knows they are filing a ticket.
 *
 * The reason set is fixed so the queue can be triaged by severity without reading every
 * note. The labels say what each one *means to the reader*, not what it is called in the
 * enum — "It gives wrong answers" is answerable; "inaccurate" is a category.
 *
 * **One dialog, two entry points, deliberately.** The conversation entry point could have
 * had its own component with warmer copy, and then there would be two reason lists to keep
 * in step with one backend enum. What actually differs is the title, the lead-in, and
 * whether a conversation is on offer — so those are the only things `sessionId` changes.
