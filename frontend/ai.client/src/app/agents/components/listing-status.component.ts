 * requested" without the reason is worse than no badge at all, and D13 is explicit
 * that admin edits to presentation are shown rather than made quietly.
 *
 * `part` splits the two halves for a layout that needs them in different places — My
 * Agents' list view puts the badge inline beside the name and the note on its own line
 * below. It is a *split*, never a filter: no caller may render `'badge'` and drop the
 * note, because that turns a layout toggle into a way to hide the one sentence telling
 * an author why their submission came back.
