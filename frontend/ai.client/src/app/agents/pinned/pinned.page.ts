/**
 * Pinned — the Agents a user has added to their own set, plus the ones their role seeds
 * (D8, D9, Phases 5–6).
 *
 * The rows are the same shelf rows Discover renders, and their `＋` has already become a
 * check, so removing one happens here without a second control to learn. That is the
 * whole reason the pin toggle lives on the row rather than on the page: one gesture,
 * everywhere it appears — including on a role-seeded row, which a user removes exactly
 * like their own (the dismissal is remembered, so it stays gone).
 *
 * The one exception is a **locked** seed (D9.4): the row hides the control rather than
 * disabling it. That is driven by the row's own state rather than by "is this page the
 * Pinned tab", so it holds on Discover too.
 *
 * A pin whose Agent was deleted, or whose visibility narrowed, is simply absent: the
 * server resolves the list against the viewer on every read, and it does not delete the
 * underlying pin for either reason.
