/**
 * A live, scaled-down render of one artifact, for the library's grid
 * cards.
 *
 * ## Why a real iframe and not a screenshot
 *
 * The obvious way to build this is the way Claude does: rasterise each
 * artifact server-side and serve a PNG. That needs a headless-Chromium
 * Lambda, a bucket path, a backfill, and — the part that actually
 * decides it — executing user-authored HTML *server-side in our own
 * account*, which is a materially different threat model from the
 * client-side null-origin sandbox we already trust.
 *
 * Everything needed to render the artifact in the browser is already
 * built and deployed: an isolated artifact origin, a short-lived render
 * token, a strict CSP, and a `frame-ancestors` that already names the
 * SPA. So a thumbnail is the render path we have, scaled down — no new
 * AWS resources, no new IAM, no new way for artifact bytes to be
 * executed.
 *
 * ## Isolation
 *
 * Identical to `ArtifactViewerComponent`: `sandbox="allow-scripts"`
 * **without** `allow-same-origin`, so the framed document is a null
 * origin and cannot touch the artifact origin's storage or cookies. Do
 * not add `allow-same-origin` here either.
 *
 * The frame is additionally wrapped in an `inert` + `aria-hidden`
 * container. That is not decoration: a thumbnail is a picture, and
 * without it every card would inject a whole focusable document into the
 * page's tab order — a keyboard user would tab through the *contents* of
 * twelve artifacts to reach the next card. `inert` is what makes the
 * `aria-hidden` honest, since `aria-hidden` over focusable content is an
 * a11y defect on its own.
 *
 * ## Cost
 *
 * Every mounted preview is one mint (DynamoDB GetItem + an HS256 sign),
 * one render-Lambda invocation, and one S3 GetObject. The render path is
 * `CACHING_DISABLED` at CloudFront — it has to be, the token is in the
 * URL — so none of that is cached and a page view costs one round of it
 * per visible card.
 *
 * Two things keep that bounded. Previews mount lazily, on intersection,
 * so a library of any size costs only what is looked at. And a mounted
 * preview is never unmounted: scrolling back up must not re-mint and
 * re-invoke. The ceiling is therefore "artifacts the user actually
 * scrolled past", which is fine while `/artifacts/library` is
 * unpaginated (a user's whole library fits well inside one DynamoDB
 * page). If that endpoint ever gains paging, this needs LRU eviction of
 * off-screen frames to go with it.
