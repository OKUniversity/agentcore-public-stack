/**
 * One submission, in full, with the decision at the bottom of it (D2).
 *
 * **What this page is for.** The review queue could name a submission but not show one.
 * `instructions` is gated to owner/editor on `GET /agents/{id}`, and that read 403s a
 * non-owner outright when the agent is PRIVATE — so the person deciding whether to publish
 * something could not read its system prompt, could not see what it binds, and on a *first*
 * submission had nothing at all to read, because the review diff is empty by construction
 * when nothing is published to diff against.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Everything here is the frozen snapshot.** The live record is the author's draft and
 * they can keep editing it while the row sits in the queue; approval promotes
 * `submittedVersion`. A page that read the draft would show one configuration and publish
 * another — which is the window `AgentVersion` was introduced to close. The one exception is
 * reachability, which is a fact about *now* and cannot come from a snapshot.
 *
 * Layout is deliberate: identity and warnings first, then instructions (the thing being
 * reviewed), then what it reaches, then the diff for a resubmission, with the test drive
 * beside it and the decision bar pinned at the foot. A reviewer should not have to scroll
 * back up to act on what they just read.
