/**
 * Test-drive the submission under review, before deciding on it.
 *
 * **The gap this closes.** A reviewer could read a name and a category and, once the
 * submission review page arrived, a system prompt — but had no way to find out what the
 * agent actually *does*. `/assistants/{id}/test-chat` is not that harness: it is
 * owner/editor-only, needs processed documents, and passes `enabled_tools=None`, so it
 * exercises none of the agent's bindings. Chatting with the agent normally is not it
 * either, for a subtler reason — `resolve_invocation_agent` hands a non-owner the
 * *published* snapshot or the live draft, so a reviewer would be test-driving anything
 * except the version they are about to approve.
 *
 * So this streams through the same real invocation path the main chat uses, with
 * `reviewPreview` set. Server-side that resolves the agent to the snapshot under review
 * (`resolve_review_agent`) and bypasses the PRIVATE visibility check — a PRIVATE agent can
 * be sitting in the queue, and an ordinary read 403s on one. The scope is re-checked
 * against the caller's own roles there, so this flag cannot widen anything on its own.
 *
 * ⚠️ **It runs under the reviewer's identity, and that is worth saying out loud on the
 * page.** Binding resolution is RBAC-filtered per invoker, so a tool the reviewer lacks
 * behaves differently for them than for the users who will pin this. The banner says so
 * rather than letting a clean test drive read as proof it will run for everyone.
 *
 * The `preview-` session id keeps the whole exchange out of the author's conversation
 * history, and the invocation path skips its bookkeeping writes (`lastUsedAt`, share
 * interaction) for a review preview — a reviewer poking a submission is not use.
