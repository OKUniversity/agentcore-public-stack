/**
 * The review diff (§6.1).
 *
 * Two properties are worth guarding, and neither is about how it looks.
 *
 * **It must not fetch until asked.** The queue is a list of decisions; a diff per row on
 * load would pull every pending agent's full instructions down to render a control nobody
 * opened. That is a behavior the template can silently lose.
 *
 * **"First submission" must not read as "nothing changed".** They are opposite claims —
 * one means "read all of this", the other means "approve it" — and the backend sends a
 * distinct flag precisely so the UI cannot collapse them.
