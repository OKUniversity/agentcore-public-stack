/**
 * "What changed since I approved this?" — the reviewer's actual question (§6.1).
 *
 * Before this, a submission arrived in the queue with no reference to what it replaces, so
 * a typo fix and a full instruction rewrite looked identical and both got the same careful
 * read. The point is asymmetry: make the cheap approval cheap without making the expensive
 * one easy to miss.
 *
 * **Collapsed by default, loaded on expand.** The queue is a list of decisions; fetching a
 * diff for every row up front would pull every pending Agent's full instructions down to
 * render a badge nobody has opened. The one thing shown *before* expanding is whether
 * behavior changed, because that is what decides whether the row needs opening at all —
 * and it rides the queue payload rather than this request.
