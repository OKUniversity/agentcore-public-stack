/**
 * A curated entry shown in the model catalog. Carries everything needed to
 * one-click create a fully-configured managed model — including pricing and
 * per-param specs — plus a small amount of presentation metadata for the card.
 *
 * NOTE — **the model card is the primary source for rates.** Each model's page
 * in the Bedrock User Guide publishes its full rate card (per inference option
 * and context window) alongside caching support, context windows, service
 * tiers and endpoint support:
 *
 *   docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-card-<provider>-<model>.html
 *
 * Check it first. The OpenAI-family rates are absent from the Price List API
 * entirely — those models bill through AWS Marketplace, which no pricing API
 * covers — and reading that absence as "unpublished" put three rows into the
 * dev catalog at GovCloud prices, over-charging by 20%.
 *
 * **Which source is authoritative depends on the vendor.** The per-model AWS
 * model cards above are authoritative for **Claude, Nova and the
 * OpenAI/Mantle family**; the Price List API is authoritative for **xAI,
 * Google and AgentCore**.
 *
 * ⚠️ Do NOT re-derive Claude rates from the Price List API. A full
 * enumeration of the `AmazonBedrock` offer file (run twice, a week apart,
 * across a republish) returns **10 Claude SKUs, none newer than Claude 3**,
 * and no us-west-2 SKU at all for Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 4.6, Fable 5.1, GPT-5.4
 * or Nova Micro. An earlier revision of this comment claimed the API "does
 * carry them" and told you to re-verify there; it does not, and a lookup that
 * comes back empty reads exactly like a model that is merely renamed.
 *
 * For the vendors the API does carry, re-verify with:
 *
 *   aws pricing get-products --region us-east-1 \
 *     --service-code AmazonBedrockFoundationModels \
 *     --filters Type=TERM_MATCH,Field=regionCode,Value=us-west-2
 *
 * Newer models publish `*_tokens_standard` usagetypes; older ones publish
 * `*TokenCount`. A query written for one shape silently returns nothing for
 * the other — match both, or a model looks unpriced when it is merely renamed.

/**
 * The OpenAI family on `bedrock-runtime` via the Responses API.
 *
 * Rates are the **Geo CRIS, Short Context (272K)** row from each model card —
 * Geo CRIS is the tier the `us.*` inference profiles resolve to, and these
 * models are inference-profile-only (no ON_DEMAND). Verified 2026-09-06,
 * re-verified for GPT-6 Astra 2026-09-11.
 *
 * **Every card in this family publishes two price tables, and the tier is
 * selected by the ACTUAL token count of the request** — not by a declared
 * window, and not by a separate model id. Settled 2026-09-11 (see
 * `docs/kaizen/review-queue.md`): the Price List API encodes `-long-ctx` as a
 * value of `tokenType` under an identical `model` attribute, GPT-5.6 Terra
 * declares a 1M window against a single model id yet still publishes a
 * reachable Short Context table, and our own Cost Explorer rows bill
 * `_standard` and never `-long-ctx` while calling those 1M-window ids. There
 * is no field in which a window could be declared: `maxInputTokens` below is
 * ours, is read only for compaction and telemetry, and never reaches a
 * Bedrock request.
 *
 * That is exactly why `maxInputTokens: 272_000` is load-bearing. It does not
 * protect us from being over-charged — nothing here does. It keeps the single
 * flat rate per bucket that `CuratedModel` can hold **arithmetically true**,
 * because a request that crosses 272K bills input at 2x, output at 1.5x and
 * both cache buckets at 2x. Raising it silently UNDER-charges every long turn.
 *
 * `supportedParams` was deliberately absent here until 2026-09-12, when it was
 * MEASURED — the bar this comment has always set. AWS still publishes no
 * parameter table for these models (`model-parameters-openai.html` documents
 * only the open-weight gpt-oss family), so the evidence is the endpoint's own
 * responses, probed against all four ids in us-west-2:
 *
 *   - `reasoning.effort` — sending a deliberately invalid value returns a 400
 *     that ENUMERATES the enum: "Supported values are: 'none', 'low',
 *     'medium', 'high', 'xhigh', and 'max'." Identical on Sol, Terra, Luna and
 *     Astra, and it matches the launch blog ("They also support none, low,
 *     medium, high, xhigh, and max reasoning effort"). Two independent sources.
 *   - `temperature` and `top_p` — hard 400 on all four: "Unsupported
 *     parameter: 'temperature' is not supported with this model."
 *   - `max_output_tokens` — accepted.
 *
 * That last pair is why declaring a spec here is a FIX, not just an enabler.
 * With no spec the #915 guard stays permissive, so a `temperature` reaching
 * this family from any caller that can set one kills the turn with a 400
 * mid-stream. Declaring them `supported: false` drops them before the request
 * instead — the same failure class the guard inversion was written to close on
 * Claude Opus 4.7.
 *
 * `reasoning_effort` defaults to `medium`, which was also measured rather than
 * assumed. Neither the cards nor the blog publish a default, so the question
 * was what the provider does when the param is ABSENT — which is not the same
 * as sending `none`. Sending nothing still reasons; `none` is an explicit
 * "off". Three samples per level on Luna, in reasoning tokens:
 *
 *     unset  285 / 516 / 327   (mean 376)
 *     none     0 /   0 /   0
 *     low    221 / 222 / 230   (mean 224)
 *     medium 274 / 346 / 303   (mean 308)
 *     high   516 / 363 / 497   (mean 459)
 *
 * So the implicit default already sits around medium, and declaring `medium`
 * is cost-neutral-to-slightly-cheaper (-18% reasoning tokens), NOT an increase.
 * It is declared anyway because otherwise the provider can move its own
 * default and our spend follows with no code change and no signal — and
 * because a declared default is what lets the picker show the level in force
 * instead of a blank row. Counts are noisy (unset spanned 285-516 across three
 * identical calls), so treat the middle levels as roughly interchangeable.
 *
 * The level that actually moves the bill is `max`: ~2.3x the output tokens of
 * unset on Terra, and reasoning bills as output. It stays in `allowed`
 * deliberately — dropping a level from that list is the lever if the exposure
 * is ever unwanted, since the picker and the backend both read it.
 *
 * GPT-6 Astra inherits this default by sharing the helper. Its effort ENUM was
 * probed directly, but its token counts were not — medium there is an
 * extrapolation from its GPT-5.6 siblings, not a measurement.
 *
 * The standing rule is unchanged — a declared spec flips the guard from
 * permissive to restrictive, so a wrong entry silently blocks a parameter the
 * model really accepts. Add or widen one only from published or measured
 * evidence, and re-probe rather than assume when a new sibling ships.
